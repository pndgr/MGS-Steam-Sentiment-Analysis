I first played in 1998 when I was 10 years old and the memory is still fresh in my mind. It's a beautiful, cinematic piece of game-as-art that deserves its place in the hall of gaming fame; I couldn't begin to explain all the reasons why it's a masterpiece. It's for that reason that I URGE you not to play this terrible version of it - it'd be an utter travesty if this was your first experience of such a game.  Others have recommended the GOG version and I can't speak from experience about that, but I can ask you to not choose this one. I experienced crashing in nearly every individual cut scene after each boss fight no matter what I did or what settings I changed, until I eventually gave up and got through the game by mashing the ""skip"" button at the start of each one. I replayed some of the boss fights four or five times in an attempt to actually get to watch them to no avail. All that wonderfully scripted dialogue, backstory, action and intrigue, rendered completely inaccessible by a terrible port, and by port I mean an inferior emulated version. I'm not complaining about the lack of quality of life improvements (there are none so don't expect any, including visually); I'd just have been happy to play the exact game I played in 1998 with no issues on a modern system. You could do a better job emulating this yourself, if you were so inclined. I've not played the Master Collection versions of MGS 2 or 3 yet, perhaps they'll fare better, but this version is just not worth your time.","","false","1721669215","1721669215","false","0","1","0.525862038135528564","false"

I finally got around the first one recently and wow... well, I honestly wasn't sure what I was expecting. It's pretty awesome and also funny in several ways.

The art and design is really appealing and definitely has that classic vibe to it. It looks old sure but, it's not bad at all and it is sort of charming to me. It feels like this kind of game that takes itself seriously but not too seriously and likes to bend some things. I really love all the art in this game, and it's a bit of a shame I missed out on these games during my childhood.

The story is just wow. It is definitely out there and I love it. My favorite part of this game. The fourth-wall breaking is not too in-your-face about it and it is tastefully placed in a way that it's really hilarious. Also, really loving all the extra voice acting for all sorts of things like tips and tricks, and otherwise. It really has a lot on this department and I appreciate it. It's a wacky, but fantastic story overall and I love it. Well done, Hideo. :D

I think its biggest weakness however is the gameplay. It suffers from the same curse that a lot of great old games seem to have: clunky and non user-friendly mechanics. This game is really tough, I'm not sure how young people back in the day played through this without genuinely getting angry at it. Then again, I played plenty of PS1 and PS2 games back then with a similar problem and I remember all sorts of frustration and multiple attempts just to get through one level.

I think maybe back then we never gave it so much thought and took the challenge, but nowadays... these kind of difficult gameplay mechanics just do not apply today. That's how usually you can tell that this game is really old, because it just does not play as well as any modern game. Still, I went through it and I can't say that I did not enjoy it. Final boss though... I think I lost a part of my soul trying to get through it.

Regardless of that, I really recommend the game. I think it definitely deserves its place in gaming history. If you haven't gotten through the MGS series yet (like yours truly... lol), definitely start as soon as you can. As a lot of MGS fans seem to say, you'll 'get it' once you play the games... and I think I definitely get it.","","true","1721577699","1721577699","true","0","0","0","false"

Other than that, they barely did anything with this. Without a CRT filter it looks like a jagged mess and the old control scheme is jarring to get used to.

As a game, I can see how this was brilliant for its time, but gameplay has not aged well at all. The tank controlls feels horrible, and the locked top down perspective in a 3D-environment leads to a lot of janky moments, particullary when you have to aim at anything not directly aligned to the X- or Y-axis.  The writing and characters however are forever awesome. 

This was my first time playing it, and I am glad I did, janky gameplay or not.

Hope they get around to properly remaking this sometime after MGS Delta.","","true","1721421585","1721421730","true","1","1","0.525862038135528564","false"

I'm playing MGS1 on my steam deck because I feel it's more forgiving to the low rez. I also played the originals when they came out on console so to me it's a lot more about nostalgia.

Let me just start that if you're hoping this will upgrade ANY graphics at all from the original, you will hate it here. This is a straight lazy as possible port of the classic games. You would likely have a much better experience emulating them as the emulators will provide better tooling to get a lot more out of your game. Personally I love the feel of the original MGS series and the fact that they have left it very untouched at this point. Sure I would have loved a complete overhaul of MGS1's graphics but I'm just happy to be able to play it again. 

On the steamdeck, it plays very well though I wish they would have updated the controls a bit since the main difficulty of the game is highly due to choppy controls. Like how difficult is to guage how close is too close to choke a guard out or how bad aiming the sniper rifle is. I can totally get over this by reminding myself that it's the original game in its entirety. 

I would have liked for them to drop hints on the L1 + R1 settings as that comes in very handy when fighting psycho mantis. Obviously on my steamdeck I have no problems getting 60fps minimum and all of the buttons work well. They have also included a steam deck button icon mapping which they did a trash job explaining but it works well in game so I was never confused on which button to press. 

As a fan of the original series, I'm appreciating the fact that I get to relive my childhood and play some of the greatest games ever made again. If you're like me and just want to feel the nostalgia of amazing games before subscriptions, loot crates, DLC's, expansions, constant bug fix updates, etc. then this might be for you.","","true","1721366526","1721366526","true","0","0","0","false"

Do you remember love?
Love from a tormented heart?
Not fleeting, as with music at night,
But an eternal love.

Now tainted,
Go now and reclaim it,
Go now and love,
Recall the times when you were happy,
Recall the times when you laughed.

Life is wonderful.
Do you have faith in it?
Turn your face to life,
To eternal joy.

What happened to those days?
What happened to those nights?
Do you remember how you turned to grief? 
Do you remember how you turned to sorrow?
Is the blame mine or ours?

Our feelings grew faint.
What caused our grief and fighting?
Can there be beauty in life?
If you seek it out,
Can there be happiness in life?

    [*] While it may show some signs of age, Metal Gear Solid still feels like it was ahead of its time, especially for a game that came out on the Playstation 1 in 1998. It's definitely worth playing today.

虽然这篇测评大部分国人无法看到，并且科乐美确实不是个值得夸赞的公司，但是我还是想就游戏本身而言，谈一谈自己的看法。

如果用如今2024年的眼光去看待这一款首次3D化的MG系列作品，玩家可能会感到诸多的不适。例如，答辩一般的操作手感，不仅仅是视角的转换令人难受，摇杆的滞后同样让人感到捉急。尤其是射击系统，让“现代人”非常的不适应，没有辅助瞄准的手柄简直是突突人的噩梦。但是种种瑕疵，如果放在1998年那个游戏3D化才刚刚起步的年代，或许显得就不那么重要了。单论游戏性而言，Metal Gear Solid（后文称MGS1）仍然能够吊打20多年后的很多游戏，我们不得不感慨小岛秀夫的天才想法：各种奇奇怪怪的细节和彩蛋，比如用箱子伪装在卡车后，可以被敌人自动传送到箱子上标着的地点；就算你没有拿到关键道具，也有方法能够通过关卡，例如没有红外仪可以用香烟来识别红外线；不少于宫崎英高的恶趣味，例如各种突然出现的机枪摄像头，和突然出现在仓库地板上的地雷。

[h2]游戏性相关[/h2]
本作的设计，主要是[b]潜行[/b]和[b]BOSS战[/b]两块大头。潜行部分，实话讲和后续的其他MGS作品相比，还是比较稚嫩的。小岛秀夫是有意去创造多种解题思路的，VR训练关卡就是最好的例子。但是受限于PS1的机能，简陋的环境和相对较少的武器设定很难发挥出玩家的脑洞。而BOSS战部分，在我看来是非常值得吹一下的。各种脑洞大开的创意，让整个BOSS战显得十分有趣，尤其是精神螳螂这一关卡，是游戏史上教科书级别的“打破第四面墙”的设计。每一个BOSS的花样都不一样，初次游玩的玩家也不需要背板就能通过，在如今仍然具有借鉴意义。当然，最后的固液蛇互相抡王八拳除外，虽然小岛个人喜欢这玩意，也在《Death Stranding》中有相关致敬，但是玩家玩起来多少有点折磨了。

此外，从本作开始，我们就能一瞥小岛对于[b]手柄[/b]的极致开发。除开游戏中武器和装备的自由切换以外，小岛利用手柄的震动，实现了游戏和玩家的互动。例如，令我印象最深的是Naomi在Solid Snake被抓入牢房拷打后，Snake说自己的肩膀很疼，Naomi居然让玩家把手柄放在自己的肩上，然后用震动实现类似按摩的效果，然后用Nanomachine将说辞合理化。我敢说全世界没有几个制作人能有这种想法，并且精神螳螂的BOSS战前也有类似的桥段。虽然用手柄玩FPS射击多少有点反人类，但是对于工具的开发，没有人不会赞叹小岛的设计。

我们再来谈一谈[b]地图[/b]的设计。我一直非常反感现在如今的3A大作，动不动就是什么开放世界大地图，多个场景传送切换。这本质上是一种美术的堆砌，实际上是不需要动脑的偷懒行为，场景看似好看，实际上就是个花瓶。而小岛的地图，就算主要场景就局限在两个塔，地下三层之中，但是却和剧情流程有机的结合起来。例如拿到不同等级的卡可以回头进入曾经进不去的房间拿道具，在和Sniper Wolf对狙的时候要回去拿狙击枪，这虽然有跑图增加时长的嫌疑，但是如今哪个游戏不要跑图的？同一个场景不同的花样，同一个BOSS不同的花样，我希望现在的游戏制作人和小岛好好学学，不要整天偷懒不动脑子，设计出来一堆无聊的地图。

[h2]剧情相关[/h2]
回到喜闻乐见的剧情环节。本作的剧情属于是好莱坞式爆米花，个人英雄主义大片，还有美人爱英雄的桥段。此外，本作的剧情节奏是有比较大的瑕疵的，尤其是小岛特有的长播片，会让玩家感到非常的不适应。典型代表就是固液蛇在Metal Gear上抡王八拳的前后，都有非常长的对话动画。特别是在打完抡拳头的BOSS战后，玩家实际上是缺乏一个情绪上的宣泄的，而小岛却用播片来对玩家进行说教，这多少有点令人头大。当然，这点坏习惯小岛一直死活不改（笑），粉丝玩家也只能接受了，也算是小岛特色。但是，本作的剧情仍然是非常值得称赞的，因为小岛做到了三点：第一，在有限的时间和空间内进行剧情阴谋的多次反转，令玩家感到惊喜不断，让本来俗套的故事增添了一些趣味，这部分涉及剧透不详细展开；第二，极其优秀的人物塑造。首先，电台的存在让本来扁平的人物变得丰满。在不同的时间不同的场景和电台中的人对话，会有不一样的故事。并且小岛还通过电台来引导玩家进行游戏，这比如今那种直白的教学关卡优秀太多。在此表白一下可爱的Mei Ling小姐姐，本作最喜欢的女性角色。其次，反派的人物塑造大胆而有深度，并通过反派的塑造对比主角的形象，让叙事更加深刻。第三，我们可以看出小岛秀夫对这个世界的寓言，虽然大部分时间被爆米花剧情所掩盖了，但我们很明显能够感受出小岛的远见，而这些部分，将在其他MGS作品中获得更多的展开。

[h2]总结[/h2]
我真的很喜欢这种故事。90年代国际社会风起云涌，政治形势诡谲莫辨，冷战刚刚结束，核战争的阴霾还在人类的头顶飘荡，这种放射尘的味道，是21世纪的新玩家所不曾接触的。那个黄金年代日本诞生了多少相关的作品，从押井守的《攻壳机动队》，到小岛秀夫的《合金装备》等等，那种半科技半魔法的题材下，隐藏了多少知识分子对历史的反思和对未来的期待。

当然，对于游戏界而言，98年也是一个井喷式爆发神作的一年。在同年的作品中，有V社的镇社之宝《半条命》，有卡普空的《生化危机2》，还有老任的《塞尔达传说：时之笛》，以及《博德之门》、《星际争霸》、《辐射2》等——不得不感慨，除了小岛以外，98年真的是一个神奇的年份，多少传奇从这里开始，或许这就是那个技术不够发达的年代，游戏制作者对艺术的真正热爱吧。

说了这么多，做个简短的总结吧。这绝对是一款每一个热爱潜行类游戏的玩家都值得体验的佳作，虽然不免有时代的瑕疵，却多添了一番怀旧的风味。这也绝对是每一个游戏制作人都需要游玩的一部佳作，小岛秀夫的理念永远值得学习和借鉴。最后的最后，让我们用那个惯例来做结尾吧——[spoiler]F**K Konami！[/spoiler]","","true","1720031552","1720137310","true","0","4","0.579290986061096191","false"

Now, let me address some common complaints:
- [b]Slowdowns and input lag[/b]
Yes, the [i]default download[/i] of the game has unbearable slowdowns and slight input lag. That is because for some reason they have decided to only include the European (PAL) version in the initial download.
Due to technical circumstances of the time the game was first released, European releases of console games ran slower than US releases, so the first thing you need to do is:
[b]Go to DLC options in Steam and download the ""North American Pack"", then choose English (US) when launching the game[/b]
This will solve all slowdown and input lag issues.

- [b]Analog controls[/b]
The compaint that the game doesn't have analog controls is false, or at least outdated. You have full 360 degree movement when using a controller.
If you are talking about the ability to ""walk slowly"", this game doesn't have that feature. (And has never had it in any release)

- [b]Graphics quality[/b]
This one is fair. The game is rendered at native PS1 resolution of 320x240 pixels and while there may be some charm to it, there's no denying it - it looks ugly. And with the default bilinear filter it arguably looks even uglier. Why didn't they upscale the emulated graphics is definitely a mystery, as that is a standard feature of hardware rendered emulation.

- [b]Missing native port[/b]
Also a mystery. Why did they not include the native PC port released on GOG in 2020? It works flawlessly on modern systems and has support for higher resolutions. While it does have some bugs that this version doesn't, they are minor they could've put in some effort to fix them.
If this collection also included that port alongside all the others, it would've been truly complete.

In conclusion, while this is not the perfect way to experience the game, it is certainly good enough and I recommend that you play it if you haven't.","","false","1719926393","1719995327","true","0","33","0.78931736946105957","false"

Questo gioco ha messo 1 punto aprendo mille strade diverse ai giochi a venire, infatti quest'ultimo ha al suo interno idee che tutt'oggi nei giochi tripla A non riescono a infilarci, come per esempio il fatto delle impronte sulla neve che vengono viste dai nemici e successivamente seguite fino al target, davvero fuori di testa.
Tutti i nemici di questo gioco hanno una profondità ed una grandezza al loro interno che va piano piano ad aprirsi andando avanti.
Davvero tutti iconici dal primo all'ultimo.
Metal Gear è appunto un tactical espionage action (genere inventato da kojima) che attualmente non ha rivali, e la gente può venirmi a dire tipo Hitman, golden eye 007... sta zitti veramente.
il nome metal gear è un nucleo che contiene al suo interno un mistero infinito e agonizzante, con dei protagonisti ignari della propria esistenza.

Tüm Soulsları 100'lerce saat oynamış birisi olmama rağmen hiçbir souls bossu beni MGS1 bossları kadar strese sokmadı. Hikayeye ve sunumuna gelecek olursak, MGS1 gerçekten günümüz oyunlarının neredeyse %90'ından daha iyi bir hikayeye, lore'a, ve sunuma sahip. Bu konuda oyunu oynama sebebim zaten oyunun harika hikayesi oldu. İlk başta klasik bir iyi asker kötü asker bam güm hikayesi gibi gözüken MGS, oyun ilerledikçe hikayeye dahil olan karakterler ile, dallanıp budaklanan olay örgüsüyle, başarılı sayılabilecek plot twistleriyle ve insanı ekrana kitleyerek hikayenin kilit noktalarını anlatan ara sahneleriyle dediğim konu başlıklarında inanılmaz başarılı bir oyun. Ancak bahsettiğim üzere MGS1 günümüzde inanılmaz seviyede outdated kalmış bir oyun, oynanmasını tavsiye etmemekle beraber kesinlikle internetten oyunun hikayesine bir bakmanızı öneririm. Ve evet oyunun 98'de çıkması, övgü yağmurlarına tutularak oyun dünyasında yeni bir devir başlatması dikkate aldığım bir unsur değil, oyuna saygı duyuyorum ama benim için önemli olan günümüzde oyunun bana neler hissettirdiği. Kısaca özetlemek gerekirse, MGS1 hikaye ve hikayenin sunumu hariç her konuda vasatın çok çok altında bir oyun, kendinize eziyet etmek istemiyorsanız oynanışından uzak durmanızı, internetten bu oyunun harika hikayesine tanıklık etmenizi tavsiye ediyorum.","","true","1718131211","1718704193","false","0","0","0","false"

自分の撮り方が悪かっただけなんでしょうか？

若干ネタバレに触れるかもしれないのでぼかした表現になりますが、メモリーカードの再現だけでも新規で買う価値はあったと個人的には思っています。

とはいえ25年以上前の、プレイステーション時代のゲームなのでポリゴンは荒いし操作方法も洗練されていないしで、そういうのが苦痛であるのなら楽しめないかもしれません。

I wish people read descriptions properly prior to leaving bad reviews. Konami stated (even in the main menu) they haven’t changed anything as their aim was to keep it true to the original experience we all love and that’s exactly what they’ve done, I don’t understand the poor reviews.

Having purchased a steam deck recently one of the few classics I was definitely wanting was MGS. Many of you know it is available to get on the PSX/PS1 emulation so I was curious to see which version was better. I read a few reviews on here and a number of reviewers stated this was a terrible port, very buggy and it was free/cheaper to get the emulated copy, so why would I get this?

Well, It has achievements, it has the steam community,  has the original artwork that sits nicely in your steam library as opposed to your emulated library, has full controller support (I played with the Xbox controller). Also there’s been a number of patches/updates to this in the past couple of months which seems to have sorted most of the issues others were having.

So I decided to buy this as I was willing to put up with any issues if it meant having an official Steam version. 
There were no bugs, no issues, the game had a gorgeous main menu interface with plenty of extras, also as this game is part of the HD collection it contained all the VR missions, special missions and DLC which back in the day was only available in North America or Japan. The game has better in game settings and options to tweak to your taste. I completed this within 18 hours and I didn’t encounter any issues. Absolutely nostalgic and very thrilled I got this because it works as it should from the get go. Does it look amazing? Nope it looks the exact same as it did 26 years ago and the graphics and controls haven’t aged greatly but you don’t play this game for the graphics it’s for the original experience, nostalgia and the memories of a whole generation of snakes we were a part of.

Thoroughly enjoyed it and an absolute pleasure to revisit especially on the deck. Please note I played this game in the ‘window view’ which is set by default. Full screen for me didn’t look or feel right so I went by Konami’s default recommendations and, well .. “Age didn’t slow me down”.

P.S for now I don’t see a reason to get the emulated version, I may do eventually just to satisfy myself that I tried both but for now this does everything I needed it to.","","false","1717208168","1717210279","true","2","60","0.805647611618041992","false"

I ask you ignore the one worded negative comments saying that the ""control porting is bad"" to which the game runs great if you have an Xbox controller and I have had no issues which feels exactly the same when I played on my PS2 back in the simple days of gaming in the glorious early 00s. Also, to those moaning about there being ""no autosave"", yes that is true but again this game came out in 2004 which were the days where autosave wasn't a thing and it really isn't hard doing this manually which is through nano-communications to which I actually find this to be a cool feature.

So far, I have had absolute zero problems with this game, the controls are responsive, the graphics I still consider are excellent especially for the year it came out compared to many other games in that era. The other thing I loved about Kojimas MGS franchise is the excellent cast of characters, and the stories grips you with it's narrative. I found myself dialing codecs every now and then to remind me of directives and that you hear more about the characters backgrounds during the games. 

The only thing that will make one rage is using the sniper rifle that will make you struggle to aim with the wobbly lens and having to pop pills like Keith Moon on drugs to get a steady aim to shoot a certain wolf that loves sniping or to escort a certain lady to clear claymores, kill guards from a distance and destroy ciphers etc. Bearing in mind this was always the case during the PS2 era.

Overall, I am pleased with my purchase made and I sincerely hope Konami release the 4th game as I never had the chance to play this having not owned a PS3 at the time.","","true","1717165485","1717173216","true","0","2","0.49139973521232605","false"

Cosas simples que deberían estar en este ""remaster"" como por ejemplo: que la interfaz y el juego se adapte a la resolución de tu escritorio (de 1080p en adelante) no están, y te ves obligado a utilizar mods creados por la comunidad; salvadora una vez más.

Independientemente de eso, lo estoy disfrutando como un crío. Es la primera vez que tengo la oportunidad de probar la saga ""Metal Gear"" al completo, priorizando el 1 de PS1, y el 2 y 3 de PS2; he de decir que es una auténtica gozada. No hay nada igual, ni que se le parezca ahora mismo en el mercado. Es un producto único y original; ha envejecido maravillosamente, las mecánicas jugables le dan mil patadas a títulos que se lanzan en la actualidad, y ya han pasado más de 20 años del primer ""Metal Gear""... Gráficamente resultón y muy bien terminado, sin ninguna pega a nivel jugable; salvo los controles arcaicos (teniendo en cuenta que hablamos de juegos ""antiguos"" claro). A nivel de historia: brutal, bien construida y repleta de personajes tremendamente interesantes.

En resumen, experiencia en la que todo jugador que se precie debería entrar al menos una vez en la vida, gracias y buen clencho Kojimba.","","false","1717149117","1717149117","true","1","3","0.57410198450088501","false"

While I didn't find anything super disastrous, it's kind of a shame that it didn't come with more customization options, I think if you are going to resell games from two decades ago for 60 bucks you are expected to put some work and love into them.
Achievements are really great to have and push you to do all the amazing and secret content the game has, and it is great to have all versions of the gaem VR missions included in there. Besides that it falls short in any aspect compared to simply emulating it with.

I mean... you fired Kojima and now want to exploit what he left you until it's dry, I can accept that but at least put a little more effort on it. 

I can't really recommend this as a product, I feel I payed 60 dollars just for a convenient download and achievements, and I'm kind of OK with that cause it's my favourite game ever, but you should think about it before buying this.","","true","1716669390","1716669390","false","0","3","0.471221804618835449","false"

[h1]Full Review[/h1]
Metal Gear Solid is a function of its time and can really be appreciated with a critical lens looking at the gaming landscape of the time. It's one of the very first games that took action movie sensibilities and provided a genuine blockbuster in game form that, at the time, hadn't really been done before. I know it's a meme that the Metal Gear series is more movie than game but it really is and not as a disparaging remark: all the bombastic stories and presentations you see in gaming today is thanks to this one trailblazer.

A lot of the story is presented with long intricate cutscenes and codec calls between Snake and his crew. The voice acting is amazing but the writing can feel a bit obtuse at time. It's written well, or at least better than its contemporaries, but with a modern perspective you could tell some of it was pseudointellectual for the sake of it. It's a blend of philosophy, history, and politics in a way that was new and exciting at the time but can feel like emotion-bait today. That said, the story is intricate and fleshed out, paving the way for an entire franchise's ethos going forward. It's super strong if schlocky at times.

Popularizing the stealth genre, it made several strides in making sneaking the objective. You can creep behind corners, crawl under barriers, hide in boxes, making the gameplay less action-shooty and instead relying more on learning patrols and having patience. You can avoid all combat in the game save for bosses if you're very careful, and that idea of avoiding combat was done with a lot of grace. It may not have been fully realized until the next game, though, as a lot of the mechanics do feel contextual rather than things you discover through some stroke of strategic genius.

The game is short, you could realistically complete it in just a couple of hours if you've practiced enough. But the breadth of content is definitely here. You'll miss out on a whole lot of exposition, character drama, and intrigue if you just blow through the game. You'll want to ring your team on the codec frequently as a lot of dialog can be missed. Basically after every major story beat, you can gleam more info from the major actors either related to the mission at hand, their personal backstories, or riffing on politics and philosophy in general. It's good stuff.

It's not a port at all, it's the PS1 game being emulated, and not very well. Any slowdowns as a result of the PS1 architecture just not being enough for the game reflect in this version of the game; even if your actual PC's specs are perhaps a million times more powerful, it doesn't matter because of the PS1 emulator container around the game bottlenecks performance. It's bewildering why Konami went this direction when there is a native PC port which already has a history of mods and fidelity improvements.

The Master Collection version is objectively inferior in every way other than it has some bonuses by way of a full script, a design document, achievements, and every version of the game being available in one package. But completedness is not a measure I'd praise a game on when the experience playing is so dreadful. There is close to the bare minimum of effort put into this version and it's a real shame.

I think Metal Gear Solid is one of the very best games of all time and demands much more respect than Konami gives it. To be fair, you can finally get and play MGS1 on Steam, with some decent extras, too, and it plays [i]fine[/i]: if you want to experience MGS1 for the first time or again as a series veteran, this is probably the worst way to go but even then it's perfectly playable. We could have got it much better, though, were Konami in the business of treating their celebrated franchises with any decency.

[h1]Steam Deck Specific[/h1]
With max TDP set to 3w, keeps 60fps ""consistently"", in quotes because you still contend with slowdown related to emulation. At no point did the Deck's framerate display show anything less than rock-solid 60fps but this doesn't necessarily reflect ingame. It's impossible to tell the exact performance at 3w but considering the game's age, you may as well cap it to get the best battery life. Raising TDP cap will do nothing to improve performance.

By default there was no analog control, meaning you could only move and aim in 8 directions. You may need to go into Steam controller settings and change to the official Deck control scheme which then allows analog sticks to be used.","","false","1716159077","1716159077","false","2","20","0.677660167217254639","false"

Я обожаю Metal Gear Solid, и причиной того, что этот обзор являться отрицательным стало ужасное отношение Konami к классике стелс экшен игр. В этом обзоре я объясню почему вы обязаны поиграть в эту игру и почему это лучше всего делать не посредством Master Collection Version. Обзор станет положительным только если Konami добавят нормальное разрешение и рендеринг, после чего при игре, из глаз не будет сочиться кровь. 
 
[h1] METAL GEAR SOLID - Master Collection Version - срань [/h1] 
 
Когда я узнал, что в steam выйдет коллекция игр из моей любимой серии я не мог нарадоваться. Наконец-то больше людей познакомится с лучшими частями легендарной стелс экшен саги. Что же могло пойти не так? Konami выпустили игры с тем же разрешением, что и на древних консолях, не дав игрокам даже поменять его. И если в mgs 2 и 3 это смотрится адекватно, то в первой части картинка превращается в настоящее пиксельные месиво. На данный момент лучшим вариантом остаётся пройти mgs 1 на эмуляторе с уткой в названии. Там у вас и разрешение нормальное, и картинка плыть не будет. 
 
[h1] Сюжет [/h1] 
 
После событий прошлых частей Солид Снейк отстранился от своей бывшей профессии, и начал новую жизнь на Аляске, вместе со своими пятьюдесятью собаками породы хаски. Это не могло длиться вечно. В один прекрасный день Снейка навещает его бывший командир с вооружёнными людьми. Он рассказывает герою о том, что на острове Shadow Moses в беренговом море солдаты, охраняющие секретную базу по утилизации ядерного орудия, подняли бунт и начали угрожать запуском ядерной боеголовки. Снейк до конца отказывался отправляться на очередное задание по спасению мира, но командир убеждает его, что герой скрывает свои истинные желания, что он солдат, который не может умереть от старости. Его призвание сражаться, и он жаждет этого. Командир проводит брифинг, рассказывающий нам о предстоящем задании, после чего операция начинается. Снейк на подлодке проникает в охраняемый солдатами док, скрытно проходит до лифта, на котором ранее поднялся очень похожий на него человек, и дождавшись возвращения лифта сам заходит в него. Пока лифт поднимается Снейк, снимает костюм для плаванья и на заднем фоне появляется название игры. Выйдя из лифта Снейк замечает Русский вертолёт и человека которого видел раньше. В этот момент героя знакомят с доступными на данный момент инструментами, и отпускают в кишащую врагами базу, раскрывать её секреты, преодолевать тяжёлые условия при помощи новых знакомых, и встречать старых. В Metal Gear Solid 1 интересный, закрученный, и развивающийся сюжет. Герои с течением времени меняются, раскрываются, с другой стороны, они имеют за собой прописанные истории. Не в каждой игре ты сможешь посочувствовать своим врагам, поменять своё мнение о них по ходу сюжета или зауважать их. Metal Gear Solid приносит те эмоции, которые не свойственны большинству экшен игр. Я хожу по очень тонкому льду и ступать дальше — значит начать спойлерить. Поэтому я просто скажу, что сюжет в mgs 1 — это что-то с чем-то. 
 
[h1] Геймплей [/h1] 
 
MGS 1 — это первый 3D Metal Gear. Здесь стелс стал гораздо глубже и интереснее чем в прошлых частях. Теперь Снейк может прижиматься к любой стене что поможет ему увидеть происходящее за углом. Поверхностей проходя по которым герой будет шуметь стало больше, например пролитая кем-то вода или скрипящие железные балки. Снейк научился душить и кидать своих неприятелей, он оставляет следы на снегу по которым враг может легко его вычислить. Теперь герою не нужно скрытно обходить каждую камеру, ведь у него появилась граната, которая на некоторое время их отключает. Таких нововведений не мало. Геймплей в mgs 1 очень глубокий, у вас часто появляются новые задачи, их решение благодаря огромному инструментарию Снейка становится особенно интересно. Вы постоянно открываете что-то новое - оружие, инструменты, ключ карты. Исследование локаций в mgs вознаграждается. Если будете внимательны вы сможете найти некоторое оружие или модификации для него раньше. Когда пройдёте игру вы получаете модификаторы, которые можно использовать в следующем прохождении. 
 
[h1] Советы [/h1] 
[list] 
[*] В игре есть момент, где вам нужно будет вернуться в место, где вы уже были, вместо долгого похода вы можете просто залезть в коробку находясь в открытом грузовике, и он отвезёт вас к нужному месту. 
 
[*] Когда вы увидите крыс ползая по вентиляции проследуйте за ними - не заблудитесь. 
 
[*] Снейк сможет стрелять во время бега если вы зажмёте кнопку, отвечающую за выстрел, потом отвечающую за приседание и не отпускная кнопку приседания начнёте двигаться. 
[*] Вы можете бесшумно бегать по любой шумящей поверхности если во время этого бега будете без остановки доставать и убирать оружие 
 
[h1] Вывод: [/h1] 
 
Несмотря на возраст, MGS1 всё ещё может приносить огромное удовольствие, благодаря захватывающему, не стареющему сюжету и отличному, разнообразному геймплею. А тот факт, что кат-сцены в игре с PS1 не уступают современным фильмам, ввергает в шок.","","true","1715919366","1715936821","false","1","3","0.558011054992675781","false"

Cutscenes freeze randomly preventing progress.
Some cutscenes can be skipped through bypassing the freezing point, however you cannot skip the end credits and the freeze occurs about 2 minutes into the credits. 
So if you buy this version of the game you will skipping all the cutscenes and will not be able to get the achievements tied to beating the game because the achievement trigger happens when you save the Clear Save file. A quick internet search shows this is a prevalent problem with this version of MGS

Where do I begin? When people talk about the PS1, 2 games come up to my mind, Pepsi-Man, but this isnt about that, the other game is Metal Gear Solid. I love this game, I always will. I find this version better than the Twin Snakes. The original game is great and I love it. Story is amazing, the twists are great, and there was nothing like it at the time. 

The Master Collection - I believe this game needs no fan patches, it runs very well, I also love how they included every single version, and love how we were able to load save files for Psycho Mantis (if you know, you know.) This also includes the Integral version of Metal Gear Solid which was only released in Japan at the time with some extra content, and its got the VR Missions as well.

My back is pressed hard against the concrete wall, listening to the footsteps getting closer to the corner. I hug the wall tighter as I see the barrel of a gun out of the corner of my eye. The guard has stopped. All I hear is his breathing and the pounding of my heart. He turns towards me, yet cannot see me, then turns back the other direction and starts walking away. I wait a couple seconds longer and sneak to the stacked crates on the other side.

Suddenly, a splash. My foot has hit a small puddle on the floor, and the sound has alerted the nearby guard to my presence. I must find someplace to hide. There is another guard coming from the other direction. There is no way out from this situation unless I want blood. But that is not my mission. This is a stealth operation, and silence is of the utmost importance. They must not become aware of my presence, so I make a split decision to dive back into the cold water. Perhaps they will think the splash was just that of a fish. After a minute or two, the guards are back on their normal routine, and I start the process over again.

The game was Metal Gear Solid. The mission: infiltrate an abandoned base in the middle of the Alaskan wilderness to stop a rogue military group from launching a nuclear strike on U.S. soil. The year was 1998. For years, I grew up on games where the goal was to kill as many enemies as possible. I was familiar with games like Double Dragon, Mario, or Zelda, where you kill or be killed. Metal Gear Solid was on a whole other level of game. Never before had I played a game where the way to survive was to hide, and I was hooked at the first demo when the voice actors were still Japanese.

Even though the demo only featured the dock and helipad sections of the game, I probably put in just as many hours with those two levels alone, as I did the game itself when it finally came out. We lived across from a Walmart, and it was in the days when you had to bend your neck in unnatural ways to see the screen for the demo station. I suspect my neck will pay for that sacrifice when I get much older, a struggle that millennial gamers will not understand.

Yet the sacrifice was worth every bit. Up until the release date, I collected every magazine that had MGS on its cover, soaked up every bit of information I could on the game, and played every demo enough, I could easily play through the dock and helipad sections with my eyes closed.

Finally, the day came. September 3rd, 1998. I bought my first Sony PlayStation and Metal Gear Solid; a tradition that has taken place with every iteration of the PlayStation. The wait was worth every second as I was blown away by every aspect of the game. The controls for the time were intuitive and perfect for the genre. The use of cinematics was ahead of its time. The story, with its complex plot twists and deep narrative was something never before seen in a video game. The characters, from Psycho Mantis and Gray Fox to Solid Snake and Meryl, were so multifaceted and unique, that you could not help but be enthralled and enraptured in the story and care for each character. Learning the truth behind the Cyborg Ninja and Master Miller’s true identity shocked me to the core. The final battle with Metal Gear Rex still remains one of the most climactic battles I ever had the pleasure to fight.

The game captured my imagination in a way nothing else ever had before, nor anything since. I spent countless hours and late nights playing that game, soaking in every secret, every different way to play the game and it remains one of the few games that I will go back to and play to this day. Metal Gear Solid will always be at the top of my favorite games list and will hold a special place in my heart.

Side Note:  I originally published the above for a contest that Game Revolution held.  You can find the original article here:  https://www.gamerevolution.com/originals/388689-a-love-letter-to-metal-gear-solid-how-it-captured-my-imagination-like-no-other-game

The fact is that nearly 30 years later, and I still consider Metal Gear Solid the greatest game of all time.  For it's time, it excelled in graphics, story, gameplay and every other category in a way that no game before nor since has ever accomplished.  It was the first game to utilize in-game graphics to tell the story, and utilized blurring and camera shake to help sell the realism.  It's use of the then-new rumble feature to immerse the player into the story was ground-breaking.   The characters have become classic staples in the Video Game community, and the villains were absolutely memorable, from your first encounter with Vulcan Raven to the incomparable Psycho Mantis.  Every boss battle was challenging and unforgettable.  

While some things feel dated, especially with the controls, it is a testament to the genius of Hideo Kojima how well this game still holds up after 30 years.  I hope that one day, he can reclaim ownership of the fanchise and continue the story, or at the very least, finish MGS 5 the way he intended.","","true","1714650109","1714672243","true","0","0","0","false"

The game doesn’t feel “old” except for its graphics. The story, the game design and the characters are all well made and even though the models are just a few pixels/polygons the world is immersive and charming. A big part of the game’s immersion comes from the voice acting which was probably the best I’ve ever experienced in a game. The soundtrack is great too. Some boss fights had me struggling for hours but they all have a trick to beat them easier so I won’t call it a bad game design (maybe not the hind d fight though). 
It’s just a shame Konami fucked up like they always do by doing a terrible port.

i don't think the gameplay's aged much; although it takes a few minutes to get accustomed to the controls, everything else comes very naturally. the tutorial's implemented through the codec (radio) calls throughout the game, which certainly helps.
the story is compelling, solid snake is a wonderful, perfectly flawed protagonist, and the many characters that appear throughout the game are all interesting in their own right.
if you haven't given this absolute classic a try yet, this is the perfect way to finally get to it. i promise you won't regret it. i doubt you'll be able to put it down once you've gotten started!

The game now runs normally if you follow the directions in the mentioned guide. My review will stay negative, because sadly, KONAMI lets their game be like this, hiding the fix to the problem in a tucked away settings menu that a total of most likely 10 people figured out how to find by themselves. Normal review is down there.

Booted up the game, excited to experience Metal Gear Solid for the 1st time. Only, I didn't. I was greeted with horrible choppy audio, and the game was running extremely slow. I found a fix for this in community guides, except it didn't work. The guide said to turn on controller setting, which I did, and set the response rate to ""fast,"" which should've fixed the problem. See, I would've done that, if only the settings WERE ACTUALLY THERE. There were no response speed settings, and I couldn't play the game unless I was fine listening to my speakers make agonizing cries of pain and looking at Solid Snake teleport through the pixelated graphics of this AAA ""remake."" I know that this is a game from 1998 and the graphics aren't meant to be good in 2024, but they were way worse than usual. I might as well have been playing Elden Ring on a Samsung Smart Fridge. The hour or so of playtime I have on this game is me trying to figure out how to fix this unfinished monstrosity of a game. Would love to play Metal Gear Solid the right way. If anybody can help, comment. No disrespect to the dude who wrote the guide, btw, I'm sure he would've been the most helpful guy of all time if KONAMI let me use the actual settings. 
T.L.D.R: My worst gaming experience so far, just don't buy.

[b]The first play through was BLIND[/b]. (Of course my ego had to choose the Hard difficulty level.) It was a pain to get through against the opponents. Looking for where to go... desperation. The controls were really difficult to learn. I realized that it was an old game but I wanted to continue playing it. After 18 hours of torture (Finishing the Game and i liked it).
My brain was like Surley i can easly beat this game and play for 100%.
[b]THAT WAS A MISTAKE[/b]
I had almost all the achievements together except Fox/Big Boss and VR training.
[b]Fox run:[/b]
I'm telling you, it was hell. After 2:30 hours in game but SWEATY 8 HOURS in real life, this achievement was pretty hard to get. reminder, this was the second time I played (this time on Easy). But that was not all.
[b]VR Training:[/b] Holy ****
At first I thought you should do the VR training in the game. NO, IT IS A SEPERATE DLC IN THE COLLECTION. NAAAAHHH. Who came up with something like that back then? Don't get me wrong, but what do UFOS have to do with MGS.
[i]no seriously now It was funny but 300 levels is really a lo[/i]t. (For all the archievement hunters out there, [b][u]this is my first completed game.[/u][/b] I get you why you do that but somehow I don't understand you either)
I really liked the [b]story. [/b]
[b]Music and Sound:[/b] Very good and well ported.
German dub is too funny.

Probably the worst port ever played.

This game needs mods to run properly, don't buy it now.
There is input lag and analog inputs are not full supported (it's just a Dpad 8 direction emulated). 
There are many problems with glitched audios and videos, the quality is very low with many crashes.
I had to download a lot of mods trying solve... It is just unacceptable!

The game resolution doesn't scale either! It runs with ""1080p window"" BUT the game keeps native 240p.
High FPS breaks the game making it runs faster: as result of this, it is impossible winning the Ocelot's torture getting the ""true"" final.

You can't change the native resolution or format. They added the ""16:9 format"" with an update but it just a stretched version of the native 4:3... My old VHS player or my squared TV in 90's could ""stretch"" pressing a button! The game doesn't need to be stretched, it needs a native 16:9 format options (the same work that MGS2 got in 2011 with the HD collection), as well as it need more native resolution settings and FPS fixes.

This collection is pointless. 60€ to run a PS1 game with broken audios, broken cut scenes and poor settings.

A huge update to fix everything is needed.","","false","1712616215","1715405339","false","3","149","0.759547233581542969","false"

Strap in, because we're about to embark on a journey that's equal parts espionage, action, and pure gaming magic.

From the moment you first step into the tactical boots of Solid Snake, you know you're in for something special. Whether it's sneaking past guards, engaging in heart-pounding boss battles, or unraveling a plot thicker than Snake's bandana, Metal Gear Solid delivers an experience that's nothing short of legendary.

Let's talk about that story, shall we? Buckle up, because it's a wild ride through government conspiracies, shadowy organizations, and more double-crosses than you can shake a cardboard box at. And just when you think you've got it all figured out, Kojima throws a curveball that'll leave your jaw on the floor faster than you can say ""Colonel, I'm trying to sneak around, but I'm dummy thicc and the clap of my ass cheeks keeps alerting the guards.""

But it's not just the story that makes Metal Gear Solid shine—it's the attention to detail, the inventive gameplay mechanics, and the sheer amount of love poured into every pixel. From the iconic cardboard box to the unforgettable encounters with Psycho Mantis and Sniper Wolf, every moment feels like a labor of love from a team that's firing on all cylinders.

And let's not forget about the characters. From the grizzled veterans like Snake and Otacon to the enigmatic villains like Liquid Snake and Revolver Ocelot, Metal Gear Solid is chock-full of memorable personalities that'll stick with you long after you put down the controller.

But perhaps the greatest testament to Metal Gear Solid's brilliance is its ability to captivate players of all ages. Whether you first experienced it as a wide-eyed 12-year-old on Christmas day, eagerly awaiting your turn from your older brother, or you're discovering it for the first time decades later, there's something undeniably special about the world of Metal Gear Solid that keeps players coming back for more.

So whether you're sneaking through Shadow Moses, infiltrating the Big Shell, or riding into battle atop Metal Gear Rex, one thing's for sure: Metal Gear Solid isn't just a game—it's an experience. And it's one that'll stay with you long after you've hung up your bandana and said your final ""Kept you waiting, huh?""","","true","1712584493","1712584493","true","0","0","0","false"

la version de steam deja mucho que desear podria ser mil veces mejor 
jugar el juego en español di mil vueltas al final era un dlc que pesa como 7gb porque si 
pero vale la pena el doblaje esta de puta madre para ser de 1998 
los graficos no son de ahora pero no me disgustaron para nada 
no soy ese tipo de persona por suerte
al principio costo pero me acomode a los controles 
el apuntar y disparar no me sigue convenciendo y eso que me termine el juego
pero no es injugable 
los personajes y sus historias me encantaron hasta los de codec son interesantes y eso que ni los ves en persona por asi decirlo solo son pixelarts que te hablan por llamada
los detalles que tiene para la epoca son increibles diria que tiene mas detalles que juegos de ahora
diferentes armas y cosas que te dan para avanzar de diferente forma 
da gusto investigar cada lugar para ver que opciones te da el juego
los escenarios no me parecieron para nada repetitivos las misiones no se me hicieron para nada pesadas capas al final con las tarjeta pero ni tanto se disfruta igual

en resumen el juego es espectacular no lo recomiendo para gente quisquillosa con los graficos o la jugabilidad pensando que esto es un remake o algo parecido pero vale totalmente la pena jugarlo 
es un juegazo
lastima que esta version podria ser mejor

me olvide de mencionar algo que al principio no me gusto y me parecia super incomodo pero me acostumbre que fue la camara que en algunas partes que capas el minimapa(el mas util que vi hasta la fecha) no funcionaba y te encontrabas un enemigo de frente y no te dabas cuenta o en algunos momentos tenia angulos raros o incomodos pero bueno el juego es de 1998 ps1 que de todo lo bueno que tiene lo tenian que limitar y tener algo malo (ni tanto porque es jugable igual pero lo menciono igual XD )

Story: Kojima's ""genius"" is acting like a Japanese version of Steve Jobs with autism and a scat fetish. In other words, the story is more of a perverse spectacle and less of a work of art, which is totally contrary to what 5,000 video essays on YouTube would lead you to believe. Honestly I just skip every cutscene I can.

Gameplay: the only part worse than the story. Fanboys, I'm sorry for how little I care about your feelings here. The game is not fun to play.

Conclusion: Yeah I'll probably play it a couple more times. Also I'm sorry you were raised by a single mom (Sony Play Station). I know how it feels man. My blind nostalgia is Goldeneye 64, which also sucks.","","true","1712242860","1712242860","false","5","2","0.335735470056533813","false"

This master collection port is probably the easiest way to pick up and play the game on PC, and the latest update has ironed out the majority of the technical issues it had.

That aside, it is a very bare-bones port. It is a straight emulation of the PS1 version, there are no enhancements of any kind to gameplay or visuals, and I would very HIGHLY recommend playing it with a controller. You do get some nice bonuses, however, in the form of every language variant of the game, the stand-alone VR Missions game, and the previously japan-only MGS Integral.

As I said before I would highly recommend MGS to anyone, its an amazing game that should definitely be experienced at least once.

Gameplay:
The stealth parts were okay-ish, the boss fights were insane and over the top, I love it. Only the constant back tracking really bother me and the controls on the sniper boss fights were really trashy. But overal, this game is a SOLID (lol) experince, both as a game and as a movie.

PC port controversy:
The PC port of the Master Collection is actually quite decent. It delivers the experience of playing through a Playstation 1 game, which is what Metal Gear Solid 1 is. It could be better? Yes. It could. But its an okay-is port if youre looking for a playthrough faithful to the PS1 version of the game.

Beh è METAL GEAR SOLID, titolo che oltre a fare da capostipite al genere stealth ha anche rivoluzionato il modo di raccontare storie facendolo avvicinare al mondo del cinema, da qui in poi molti sviluppatori hanno fatto lo stesso arrivando ai giorni nostri dove i videogiochi ormai non hanno più nulla da invidiare ai film.
Titolo che in più occasioni rompe in maniera geniale la quarta parete parlando direttamente al giocatore, non starò qui a parlarvi del famosissimo Psycho Mantis.
Insomma, il capolavoro che ha fatto diventare famoso in tutto il mondo il maestro Hideo Kojima.

 [b] Ora però la parte più dura, parliamo del porting: [/b]

Purtroppo il gioco è stato portato su PC e console nella maniera peggiore possibile, una emulazione 1:1 della versione PlayStation con tutte le problematiche del caso!
Vi troverete a giocare con la risoluzione nativa della PlayStation 1 di 320x240 e se giocate la versione PAL (Europea) vi troverete il frame rate a 25fps, mentre la versione NTSC (Americana/Giapponese) andrà a 30fps, quindi la comunicazione di Konami dove dichiarava che la risoluzione era di 1080p era FALSA, anzi fuorviante perché effettivamente il gioco va in 1080p ma solo nel menu.

Potevano fare molto di più per esempio dare la possibilità di giocare in inglese con sottotitoli in italiano e magari allineare tutte le versioni ad andare a 30fps.
Invece hanno preso letteralmente la ROM del gioco e fatta andare tramite un emulatore interno senza sforzarsi minimamente di renderlo presentabile.
Potevano prendere spunto dall'emulazione tramite DuckStation dove ormai si è raggiunto un livello incredibile.

Fortunatamente su PC esistono MOD che ne aumentano la risoluzione oltre a cambiare formato in 16:9 andando a sistemare quello che dovevano fare sin dall'inizio gli sviluppatori.

Per concludere, il gioco è ottimo ma il porting è scadente, detto questo non mi sento di consigliarlo.","","false","1711448234","1711467686","false","0","2","0.541666686534881592","false"

I do agree this port could've been way better, but thankfully it is now currently playable and quite enjoyable if you decide to purchase this game on a sale! But, if you have console... I prefer the console and would even say that the Master Collection is overall better on console when it comes to just MGS1, because the 16:9 ratio actually looks good on a modern 4k TV. 
 
I do not want to spoil the game, as it is one of the most revolutionary games ever made when it comes to story telling in video games! This might be a stealth game, but deep down... this series is telling an Anti-war story, & is a incredible critique on A.I. 

The main plot of the game is essentially you play as Solid Snake, a former Green beret, special operations solider for FOXHOUND unit, he's considered one of the best spies, and overall the GOAT. He is soon forced to come out of retirement to stop a special forces unit FOXHOUND turned terrorist group. FOXHOUND has taken control of a military base in Alaska (named Shadow Moses), and have threatened the United States with nuclear warfare if not given the remains of Big Boss. Your task is to stop FOXHOUND and figure out who is behind this group and why Snakes former unit had gone rough. As you play the game, you soon figure out there might be a deeper conspiracy behind the capturing of Shadow Moses. 

The main theme of the first Metal Gear solid is Genes. That your genes/DNA do not dictate your life/fate, regardless of what you inherit from your parents, Some genes may put you at a higher risk for something, but that doesn't mean that they will cause or affect said circumstances. Some genes are expressed and some are not. Some are Dominant genes and some are Recessive. For example, having a gene which allows one to retain more fatty tissue than others, does not necessarily dictate that you can never be an athlete. A lot more comes into play than just genes when dictating the terms of how you make your life out to be. 

Overall, Metal Gear Solid works as a story, and a game because it's a perfect weird mixture of espionage stealth action, it has unique supernatural elements, technology and the fact it's philosophical; as it makes you think about the greatest aspects of life and why it's important to love yourself and your loved ones. 
Because this game was so impactful for it's time, it gets my personal 10/10","","true","1710921033","1711343894","true","0","0","0","false"
"1713492688","497","392","176","2329","0","76561198049840197","0","true","english","false","160970686","Probably the best way to play the original Metal Gear Solid in current year. 

The GoG version only has the original PC port, ""Metal Gear Solid: Integral"". This has both Integral and the PS1 original. Plus exclusive novelisations.
Meanwhile for those who want an authentic experience, copies of original PS1 release likely have disc rot at this point and are thus unplayable. Couple that with the insane price of retro gaming hardware and its almost impossible to even attempt to play the ""original"".

The only real choice is between this, and emulating.
Personally I prefer this version. Easier to set up and run, with no risk of getting a cease and desist letter from my ISP or a virus from some sketchy pirating website. 
Yes, emulation COULD have superior graphics through the use of filters, which are most definitely NOT how the game was intended to be. But get off your graphics high horse, this is literally a PS1 game. You can put as much lipstick on him as you want but Solid Snake's face is literally three lines on a flat beige texture-less tube. There's just nothing here to pretty up in the first place.

The biggest issue with this port in my opinion are the weird choices for KBM controls. Not that they are unusable, just weird. WASD to move, E/M to unequipped weapons & items, 9/0 to open inventory, space to crawl, F for first person, U to grab and enter to shoot/interact. 
Plain bazzar. Yet still SO much better than the controls we got for Zone Of The Enders on PC.
Also you CAN rebind the controls but only on controller and only through Steam itself, the game has no control menu. But you don't need a third party program or anything as some outdated reviews and angry form users claim. 

I know some players have complained of glitches. yet I've encountered exactly NONE that were not already in the original version. Some times models just undulate. Some times you can look through a gap in the world and glimpse the sky box. That's how it was on a console back in 1998. 

If someone who never played MGS asked me how to best play the game, I would direct them here.
Are there better options? Perhaps in emulation. But the risks associated, plus the added challenge is a major turn off for most users.

I do miss playing this game on my PS1, with full surround sound on a home speaker set up. But that's no longer really an option thanks to Sony's antiquated disc design.

Sonunda bitirebildim. Bu seriye ilk önce 2015 yılında bilgisayar dersinde okulun verdiği pc ile hangi oyunları indirsek diye arkadaşla konuşurken neden MGS'yi indirmeyelim dedik ve indirdik ama şu zamana kadar o başlangıç dışı bir kere bile yüzüne bakmadan kapadım çünkü hitap etmiyordu. Ta ki bu tarz oyunlar yavaştan ilgimi çekmeyi başlayınca kenarıma koyup bir gün oynarım bahanesiyle listeme ekledim ve her ne kadar pc ye gelmiş olsalarda malum port durumundan ötürü uzak kaldım ve bende geç olsun güç olmasın diyip Duckstation'dan kurdum ve bugün 18 mart 2024 tarihi ile neredeyse 9 yıla aşkın süredir bitiremediğim oyunu bitirdim.

Thankfully, as of Ver.1.5.0, this is the best way to play MGS1. It's for the most part a basic emulation of the PS1 version, which automatically makes it vastly superior to the atrocious PC port from 2000, but there's some nice additions as well.

[list]
    [*]Regional versions (NA/EU/JP) of both MGS1 and VR Missions are available. The once Japan-exclusive Integral version is included as well, though some menu text is unfortunately still in Japanese.

    [*]A new pause menu where you can access various settings, but more importantly can be used to pause cutscenes.

    [*]A (PC-exclusive?) Controller Response Speed setting that, when switched from Stable to Fast, trades what I assume is authentic input latency for more responsive gameplay.

    [*]Optional wallpapers to fill the blank space that the game screen doesn't use, as well as a few (also optional) screen filters.

    [*]The script for MGS1 and a ""Master Book"" are included. They'd both be proudly displayed on a shelf if they weren't digital.

    [*]You can [spoiler]add save data from other PS1 Konami games for Psycho Mantis to read.[/spoiler]

    [*]Disc swapping is automatic.
[/list]

The biggest flaw of this port is the comically bad and unchangeable keyboard controls (E+M opens the new pause menu lmao), but a controller is the best way to play the game regardless since it uses analog input and vibration. While neither feature is essential, the former makes precision actions easier, and there's a few moments where the latter is used quite creatively.

Again, while there's some pretty good additions, this is otherwise a straight PS1 emulation, so don't expect 8K 144FPS support. However, if that doesn't bother you, or you're actually cool enough to prefer the original resolution and framerate, this Master Collection version is a solid way to play a Solid game.","","true","1710621924","1712369503","true","0","69","0.837773680686950684","false"

I think it was one of the first games I ever played, that was a stealth action type game. I think Splinter-Cell was a game that I played much later in life. I actually never owned this game on the PlayStation 1, I actually had a demo disc of the game back then. That I always kept playing over and over. Being able to beat this game now and seeing how it can end, depending on the ending you do get. I can say it's a great game to play. Even playing the VR missions is a great way to learn how to play the game before you start playing the actual game. And now that I've beaten this game, some parts of sons of liberty make more since to me. 

Being able to find the Camera and take pictures of moments in the game, and getting the chance to find a ""ghost"" in the picture is a neat way to get more info about the game. But might be a challenge to do if you don't know about it. And thankfully there's a strategy guide that you can use to help you learn about all that. And other secrets as well.

The last boss fight you have in the game is really hard at least it was for me. It's a timing thing and it's very brutal. But if you're savvy with Steam's controller support you can make a turbo button to make that fight a little easier on you. Or try to beat the boss yourself with fancy dodge moves and well timed kicks or grabbing skills to knock the boss down to stop them from getting a combo on you. 

Also, being able to hide in a box is not only really funny, but you can actually climb into the back of some trucks in the game. And use some of the boxes you find throughout the game as a fast travel of sorts too.

If you end up beating it a few times on the harder game modes, you can even have the main character Snake, in a Tux. I think this is an easter egg to some of the more classic Spy movies like the James Bond 007 movies. Cool thing is Snake is not the only character this applies to. So keep an eye out for those too when playing this again on the same save you beat it on.

So the TL;DR of it is: It's a fun game, hard at times and full of little secrets. With some fun replay value to it. I'd say get Vol. 1 of the Master collection just to have a complete trilogy. But it's up to you, don't take my word for it, I just think it's a great game.","","true","1710364602","1710364602","true","0","0","0.47826087474822998","false"

El videojuego es una joya que ha envejecido a nivel de historia de maravilla, pero hay un grave problema de adaptación de controles, no es un buen port y para nada hay el cariño que merece la franquicia de Metal Gear.
El mejor ejemplo que puedo poner para representar lo mal porteado que esta es la batalla de Psycho Mantis, en la consola original, PS1 tenias que cambiar el puerto en donde estaba enchufado el control para que este no te leyera tus movimientos, en esta versión para PC no existe ninguna manera de cambiar el puerto, no se han molestado en crear un sistema de controladores virtuales para que esa batalla se pudiera llevar acabo y tienes que superarla con un metodo alternativo, el cual requiere de guía de manera obligatoria

Für mich ist diese Sammlung nicht nur eine Gelegenheit, meine Lieblingsspiele neu zu erleben, sondern auch eine Reise in die Anfänge einer der ikonischsten Spielserien aller Zeiten.

Die Master Collection Version 1 ist nicht nur eine Sammlung von Spielen, sondern eine Hommage an ein Meisterwerk des Videospiels.

Its pretty rough,the emulator needs work to run this game better.
Ive emulated this game before and its never really run quite this bad before.
If you do go ahead and play, just be prepared for it to crash, especially near end game cutscenes.
And the sound is very laggy in parts.

I really am glad they re-released the games all like this (because they wouldn't have at ALL otherwise). Yeah fan emulators are normally gonna be better, but if you're willing to use an emulator then you will. Turning on pixel perfect mode is great for me and I really enjoy the extra stuff here. I also wish they just had the original PS1 manual in here rather than the weird online manual they're using. If only this game wasn't so fucking jankey. Story? great. Gameplay? doo doo garbage. The combat is either annoying or actively pissing me off so bad that I almost break my hand on my desk.

I own MGS for the PS1 on the PS3 (don't question it), and I played a few hours there and it was enjoyable, but I didn't really get into anything by Hideo Kojima until recently when I played through Death Stranding: Director's Cut and fucking loved it. So I went back and bought this collection and remembered why I didn't get into THIS, because it's not...great, but I will stick it out to the end to play the other games.

EDIT: Ok so I finished the main story, still agree with most of my points. I am a bit bad at the combat, the melee especially is either the worst ever or I don't get it, but I did find out there are mods for this version to basically make it one of the best versions available so yippie. I did say like ""i don't mind how doo doo this port/rerelease is"" but it is nice to have the option of a mod to make the resolution higher for replays. The MGS2 & 3 releases in the Master Collection really should've had full resolution support since it still looks great.","","false","1708908985","1709186743","false","0","7","0.472024321556091309","false"

So, that's why I can't recommend this version. To say Konami phoned this in is an understatement. The menus are nice, and the limited options that are there are appreciated, plus having the INTEGRAL version finally playable in the West is a great bit of fan-service, but my God, they fumbled hard with everything else.

Stretched textures, 'smoothing' may as well be ""liquify every asset so it looks smudged therefore less jaggy"", and the performance actually dips below 60FPS at times, like when the HIND-D loads in to attack you. I promise, that's not my hardware either, I'm rocking a high end PC that cost me four figures and runs Alan Wake 2 at 1440p 120.  A game from 1998 should be butter smooth. 

Hypothetically speaking, and I'm not at all advocating for such nefarious things as piracy or emulation, but if you were to play this on an emulator, it would look and perform leaps and bounds ahead of this very lazy, very embarrassing port. I of course do not condone or encourage such things, who on Earth would support game preservation anyway? 

If you want good remasters/ports, look no further than the newly released Tomb Raider Trilogy, because MGS1 MC Version sure as Hell isn't in the good category. If you're absolutely insistent on playing this version, I recommend the MGSM2Fix mod to get it closer to its original look and feel.

La historia, los detalles y la ambientación a pesar de las limitaciones de la época, está por encima de algunos juegos actuales. La música, el sonido ambiente y el doblaje en español es una maravilla. 

Pero el port es una auténtica basura, no permite prácticamente ajustar nada ni siquiera la resolución. Los controles son toscos, por la época y consola en la que salió, pero ni siquiera te permite cambiarlos, solo permite entre los cuatro controles principales. Emulando se puede conseguir una experiencia mucho mejor. Aprovechando más las texturas y las pantallas actuales. 

En la actualización 1.4.0  activaron un poco de suavizado y la pantalla completa pero sigue dejando bastante que desear.

No recomiendo este port y mucho menos al precio que lo venden, quizás la Master Collection Vol.1 completa cuando esté rebajada sea una mejor opción, si quieres disfrutar todas las entregas. Pero aun así recomiendo el juego, por que mereció la pena el sufrimiento para disfrutar este clásico.","","false","1707933694","1707933939","false","0","1","0.497925341129302979","false"

Things i Didn't like:

-new glitches and technical issues

I'd give this game a 8/10. Personally I would give this game a 9/10, however the current state of the game holds it back. There is a handful of issues I came across in my two playthroughs of this game. These issues are not that noticeable to new fans thankfully, only people that have played these games over the years and grew up with these games. I also believe that we should have received more content considering the price tag on each of the Master Collection Vol. 1 games. It feels really bare-bones. While I am not a fan of the game's current state, I will not deny that the game is constantly improving and becoming closer to its original counterpart. If you really want to play these games, go ahead and buy the Master Collection. However, I personally suggest waiting for a sale. You should not pay $20 for an unpolished port of a game from 1998.","","true","1707713303","1707713303","true","0","1","0.523809552192687988","false"

Legendary soldier Solid Snake is pulled out of retirement by Colonel Roy Campbell and the US government to undergo an urgent mission: the special forces unit FOXHOUND, with whom Snake had previously served, has gone rogue, taking over a classified Alaskan nuclear disposal facility on Shadow Moses Island. They take the President of Armstech, Kenneth Baker, and the DARPA Chief, Donald Anderson, hostage, and demand that the United States hands over $1 million ransom along with the remains of Big Boss, or else they'll launch a nuke against America. With the clock ticking, Snake, supported by a support team made up of returning characters from MG2 and new ones must sneak through Shadow Moses, try to rescue the hostages, find out if the terrorists actually can launch a nuke, and stop the terrorists before it's too late. However, as the plot unfolds, Snake, and you the player, find that not everything is as it seems, what with the discovery of a new model of Metal Gear that was being worked on, along with the truth behind the connections between Snake, and FOXHOUND's new leader, a man calling himself [i]Liquid[/i] Snake, who, aside from the blonde hair and British accent, looks EXTREMELY identical to our hero...

Game itself is absolutely fantastic. The stealth-focused gameplay is rather engaging, and you really need to be careful on how you traverse your surroundings if you don't want enemies to spot you. Luckily, you have various tools to help evade detection, or to give enemies the slip in case you do get spotted. Sound design and music are incredible. If there is one weak link I can identify within the gameplay, however, it's the combat. Granted, it's a stealth game, so the whole point will be to avoid combat as much as you can, but there are sequences, including boss fights, where Snake MUST use a gun and/or his fists to fight, and it's where the combat can get rather sluggish. It's mainly because of the controls of its time, however, and this is something I feel later games definitively improved upon as the series went on. With all that said, boss fights can still be rather engaging for the most part.

And then there's the story, which is incredibly enthralling and engaging, making you want to see what happens next. Great characters are enhanced by incredible voice acting for its era that still largely holds up even today. There are some really deep themes going on under the hood, if you're willing to engage with them, and this applies to many of the other games in the series too. It's not exactly aged the greatest, given that this is a game released in the late 90s, but its still an incredibly important milestone in video game storytelling, especially of the cinematic variety. It should be noted that if you don't really care about story in games, let alone this game's story, it's probably best to look for something else to play, as dialogue and cutscenes take up a good portion of the game's runtime. It's a game that you play for both the story [b]and[/b] the gameplay, and it must be noted that this also applies to every other game in the series. But if you are up for that, then you are in for a treat!

Overall, I HIGHLY recommend this utter classic. Check it out if you got the chance and the cash.","","true","1707567176","1707567248","true","0","2","0.516945540904998779","false"

I sincerely hope they won't make us pay extra for a Vol. 2 collection featuring PW and GOTP, but knowing Konami, this is likely to happen. 

If you've never played MGS and want a convenient way to play it on PC, go for it, if you already own the games on PS1/2/3 like me, think twice before you buy, is convenience worth 60 bucks?","","false","1707408731","1707408731","true","0","0","0","false"

I have beaten all 3 games and not one had any major issues, the biggest glitch I had was the game crashing if I tabbed out during 1 and 2, which is very manageable. 

the only thing I recommend is going onto Nexus Mods and getting the replaced audio mods, as it can sound a little crunched in some spots, this was the only thing I found semi-required for these games.

Port wise this is easily the best port out of the collection and it runs completely fine and ACCURATELY to what the game was like on a PS1. If you think the game doesn't run good and that it runs like a PS1 game then you're right!! That's because it's a PS1 game!!! EU players may have issues with it being locked to the 50hz PAL version but all you need to do is go to SteamDB and install the American DLC and then you'll be able to run it in 60hz.

At the time of this review I've played this for around 20 hours beating the game multiple times and I plan on playing it more and more as time goes on.

People need to stop crying about game preservation and then hating it when they actually get it. This port is a huge win for the MGS Community.","","true","1706669609","1706669609","true","0","12","0.592903256416320801","false"

Same can be said for the whole series.
Each game packed with fun, the best stealth gameplay (even today, especially starting from MGS2), lessons, emotions and views on life that will completely change you as a human… for the better.

Thank you Hideo Kojima. :hearts: Thank you Kojima Productions. And thank you Konami for allowing this timeless game series to exist, through the incredible and talented people that you hired.

And thanks to our Metal Gear Solid community, and the friends we made along the way through this wonderful game series.

Onward to play MGS2, and MGS3! And can’t wait for MGS4 to re-release finally on Vol.2.

Edited: To go into more depth, am I saying it's a bad game? No. Can it be better? Yes. It's not very well emulated either. I had to kill myself 4-5 times just get a secondary option with the statues to beat Psycho Mantis because the control port option wasn't working properly.There are things I like about both versions, like for instance I like the aiming option to aim my gun in first person view as well as the remote control missile launcher in Twin Snakes and also being able to hang on the side of railings while sneaking because it helps prevent being detected while with this game you have to take a leap of faith. Original MGS1 on the other hand I like the Gray Fox, Metal Gear Rex, and Liquid Snake boss fights better in this version. If I could combined all aspects of what I liked about both versions it would be the perfect game.

But I think this port helps a lot of people experience this game in updated fashion. This game is considered an industry staple and a lot of people want to play it, this port helps a lot. With that being said there are still a lot of frustrating things about this game. Having to play this game in windowed mode is a little annoying. I want to experience this game without having to see whats on my screen behind it. It really takes me out of the experience. I tried to play the game on full screen, but whenever i get an achievement or exit my screen it goes back to windowed mode again. I think they should fix that if they can. The remapping of the buttons is also a little furious. I have one option to pick when changing my buttons, and that one option make me use the circle button for my accept button, when i would really like to use the cross button. Not sure why this choice was made, I'm assuming this is how the original was played, but I've already gotten in the habit of having cross be my accept button, why wouldn't you let me change it. Now I'm hitting the wrong button when I don't want to and it gets a little frustrating at times.

Those are mostly the main gripes I have with this game. As for as the game itself, it is playable and it has my heart racing a lot. This is the first time I'm experiencing this game and I'm really happy with how its playing. I'm not seeing bugs, overall its an OK experience. I'm really liking the story, and of course I know its a 25 year old game and it has some outdated culture usage, but I'm enjoying it. If you're a first time player, I would recommend this to you, if you're a veteran and have played this many times, its not really worth it.

Also thanks for reading if you did!","","true","1705966579","1705966579","true","0","2","0.523809552192687988","false"

A pesar de ser un juego de PSOne me sorprendió lo bien que se juega. Sin embargo los controles si se sienten algo envejecidos. Es de los primeros juegos en contar una historia bastante completa. Y su concepto de ""Tactical Espionage Action"" es la base de muchos juegos mas actuales. 

Si algo destaca de esta entrega son sus enfrentamientos contra jefes ya que son únicos. Cada personaje tiene sus motivos y personalidades. Si bien podrían parecer algo obsoletos al día de hoy,  siguen siendo interesantes. La trama podría parecer cliché o predecible a estas alturas. Sin embargo vale completamente la pena darle una oportunidad y escuchar todos los diálogos y ver todas las escenas.

Gran variedad de armas. Cada una con sus ventajas y usos específicos. Y muchas maneras de abordar un mismo problema. Si bien es un juego relativamente lineal, hay muchas secciones a donde se puede regresar una vez conseguida cierta ""habilidad"" u ""objeto"".

Cabe mencionar que también es un juego que tiene la posibilidad de obtener hasta dos finales. Todo esto se suma para obtener una gran entrega. Llena de nostalgia y momentos de películas de acción de los 90's.

They have video options now to turn off smoothing so it doesn’t look blurry and stuff. I guess people were also having issues with input lag and they added options to help with that… but i personally didn’t have any issues.

My only two complaints is that the aiming is based on directional buttons and not analog, which makes it hard to aim sometimes, but I was able to adapt to it and was fine. The “widescreen” just stretches the screen, so I used the “pixel perfect” mode instead, which doesn’t use the whole screen but I really didn’t notice it once I really got into my play session.

For $20 USD, I don’t regret my purchase at all and think this is a great option for those that don't want to sail the high seas and emulate it.","","true","1705724026","1705724026","true","0","0","0","false"

Me pasé el 1 ayer, y coincido con la gente en que no entiendo por qué simplemente no pusieron en Steam la versión que ya existía en GOG. Sin embargo, tras unos cuantos parches no se aleja mucho de aquella versión, y esta incluye incluso el disco especial de las misiones VR, las distintas versiones regionales del juego y la versión 'Integral', la cual se supone que es una especie de ""definitive edition"". Esto, por supuesto, hace que incluya el doblaje del juego al español, que es el único juego de la saga que se llegó a doblar y es un doblaje magnífico (en GOG solo se podía jugar en Inglés). La otra gran pega que le pongo es que los controles con teclado (porque el ratón no tiene uso) están cogidos con muchísimas pinzas; Steam incluso recomienda el mando para jugar antes de iniciarlo. Esto último me parece que es el aspecto más criticable del port tratándose de un lanzamiento en PC. A pesar de eso, el port no está mal y es una opción bastante viable si te da una pereza del copón (como a mi) enchufar tu vieja consola o configurar un emulador.","","true","1705695258","1705695258","true","1","2","0.54356849193572998","false"

The controls felt more stiff than PW and Snake constantly getting stuck on walls/corners, cuz he wanted to lean against them was frustrating. Some technical problems the game has is tabbing out causes the game to flash and enter windowed mode which is very annoying, some very odd spelling mistakes (Sanek), and unfinished voice lines (specifically one codec). Fighting Metal Gear was a pain in the ass and I had to cheese it to win. 

All of those negatives aside, I thought the game was still decent all things considered. The devs have been working on patching, which I give them big props for and they even fixed some issues I had before (the issues listed above are the ones still present in-game). I wish I could give a neutral review, but if I had to choose a side- I'm gonna have to say positive. The characters are memorable and quirky with a lot of charm. I would definitely enjoy MGS 2 and 3 more, considering they have the non-lethal options and are more traditional to the ""modern"" MGS formula. What I won't forgive is getting stuck for 3-4 hours, cuz I didn't know Meryl's codec and on release the instruction booklet with it listed was bugged to my knowledge. Psycho Mantis fight was definitely my favourite. Love stuff like that. I just wish it had the Gamecube options for saves as well.","","true","1705660693","1705660896","true","0","1","0.52173912525177002","false"

And it's not only a language pack, it's a bit different version of MGS - sounds are much much better and better synced and the game is faster. Why is that? I have no idea and to be honest with you I don't think Konami is aware of it either.

que personajes super poligonales puedan transmitir tanto solo con buenos actores de voz y una trama de accion ochentosa y con suspenso constante es muy llamativo, sacando los controles que para la actualidad estan muy atrasados, la trama y la manera en la que progresa el juego se mantuvo excelente en el tiempo.

Meu primeiro contato com Metal Gear foi no 5. 
Após jogar um pouco do 5 e apreciar bastante o game, eu fiquei com esse desejo interno de jogar desde o primeiro, então eu deixei o 5 por terminar e estou indo do início.
Com o lançamento dessa coleção, apesar dos problemas que o pessoal tem apontado, eu estou gostando bastante do Metal Gear 1, e mesmo que não seja a versão HD que existe, eu tô sentindo a sensação de nostalgia do PlayStation e está me dando uma maravilhosa sensação de alegria. 
Apesar dos apesares, eu recomendo demais.","","true","1705163268","1705163268","true","0","0","0","false"

Cons
- No internal resolution slider
- had to use mods to fix a few things settings that wasn’t present in game

Pros
- the ingame option to switch controllers (useful for a specific boss fight that isn’t present in the GOG port)
- plays exactly from the ps1 game
- plays flawlessly (as expected for a ps1 game lol)

I’m terms of the game itself it was my first time playing this game and I thought the story was really good and ahead of it’s time. The only thing I would say that I didn’t like was a specific backtrack part to get a gun that I had to look up. Other than that I would recommend playing on a crt or Oled cause the game looks really good on both.

The game was advertised as a port from the PS1 original, no remake or remastering at all. I knew what I was purchasing and I got it. Is this overpriced for what you get? Absolutely. Should they have also included the PC Version that fixes most of the ""issues"" people complain about? Yes, totally. Should they have also included Twin Snakes to actually deliver every single MGS version there is in one package and justify the base asking price? YES. Thing is, that was not promised or advertised so I have no right to complain about it. I got what I paid for and what was advertised and people should start to understand that complaining about stuff that was not promised at all and tanking a game's score on those grounds is not ok in my opinion. If you don't like the product and you know what you are going to get, then don't buy it. If you want the superior version of this classic, go to another storefront and purchase the native PC release. That one has basically all the things people complain about here.

They said ""hey, you are going to get the PS1 game AS IS"" and that means no video settings, no better graphics, no audio settings, no NOTHING. That would be a remaster which is not what this is. It is an as-is re-release. Call it lazy all you want, but if you purchased it with all that info available from day 1, it's on you. So please if you are going to downvote this re-release, do it valid grounds like ""it doesn't run"" or something that prevents the product from functioning as it should. You can even validly complain about the game not being fun nowadays in your opinion due to dated mechanics if you are a newcomer and recommend against buying it on those grounds. But please, if you are a player that already knows this game inside and out and you still purchase this knowing what you were going to get... abstain from downvoting because technically it wouldn't be fair since the company delivered the product that was promised to you exactly as they said they would.","","true","1704980546","1704980616","true","4","62","0.719102382659912109","false"

It's my first time playing this classic. I have been waiting for years for these games to come to PC and the time has finally come. Let's state the obvious first; the ports are awful, all three of them. Konami spent little to no effort on bringing these games to Steam. You can emulate these games while playing them on such a better quality overall.

What can I say more about a classic that has been praised for over 25 years? Let me keep this one short, since there isn't much to say. Its ability to surprise me throughout the journey is what I liked most about Metal Gear Solid. It's no wonder they call this game a revolution in video games. Its story didn't emotionally connect with me, but I enjoyed every aspect of it.  

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3123509261

Because the AI is better than almost all of today's games, it's a challenging game even to this day. I have struggled in many missions and boss fights. The boss fights are phenomenal, there are encounters in this game that I will never forget such as Hind D, Psycho Mantis, Cyborg Ninja, and Liquid Snake. The game is full of memorable moments and that's one of the things I care the a lot in a video game. There are little details everywhere that blew my mind to this day. I will keep it short since I won't be able to add anything new to the conversation about how good Metal Gear Solid is. However, I will mention that I was shocked to see the final scene because it was very similar to Resident Evil 4's ending. Seems like RE4's ending was a homage to this masterpiece. To conclude, I am glad I experienced Hideo Kojima's genius mind once again. We are lucky to have him.

The sound is absolutely awful at default, but it's ok, the fix is simple.  All you have to do is switch the mode from full screen to Windowed mode and that's it!  Simply drag the windowed screen to fill your monitor/TV and your away to go.

Also, for anyone that's wondering about how to deal with ""that fight and controller ports"" this game has that feature built into the master controls, so you're all good there.

They have put out a patch recently that is supposed to help with these things so hopefully that HELPS and FIXES some of these ISSUES but i will also say it is still very playable and ive had no gamebreaking issues.

The story remains intact, albeit a little more goofy, but the gameplay elements brought from being on MGS2's engine removes alot of the ""who the hell thought this was a good idea?"" moments.

Thank you Konami for releasing this game, even if it is a fucked up port running on a busted emulator. A bad version is better than no version.

If you are playing for the first time, wait for the remakes (they keep we waiting, huh?). Graphics may frustrate you, as they are exactly as they were on PS1. You know that beforehand, it is not a surprise.

Story is the best from all MGSs.

VR missions is well made too, with fun missions in sneaking, weapon, special and advanced modes.

Integral version has slightly better graphics, but plays at 50hz.

Definitely worth the money, you will need good amnount of hours to play it all (story + VR).

Have at you Snake !

Now - game crashes or freezes within 30 minutes of playtime. This makes playing for any reasonable length of time impossible, especially since I WAS aiming to get the Fox/ Big Boss rank achievement. Add to that the fact that this is a lazy port of Bluepoint's Metal Gear Solid HD Collection (released 2011) with no extra features, and 
that it somehow reaches a whopping 11GB+ file size just for the FIRST of the 3 games (despite the original being less than 1GB)... It's poor. It's so poor.

You can emulate MGS1 on a low budget mobile phone. Without glitches, crashes, and with better graphics to boot. That's just how bad this port is. God I hope the other 2 games in the collection still run on my laptop...","","false","1703886465","1713479000","false","0","0","0","false"

They addressed some issues mentioned in the reviews prior to this date. They added in game menu options that effect the visuals and screen issues that can be updated in game so you can see the results on the fly. They are also continuing to update it as time goes on, but im happy with the newest update that I can recommend it.

My settings are Smoothing Off / Pixel Perfect for the resolution / Scan lines On. With that the game looks exactly how I remember it. I haven't experienced crashes. There are 1 or 2 Audio issues during specific cutscenes that use real life footage but nothing in game. My point of reverence is a 90's CRTV that had mono Speakers that was across the room. Playing this with a headset, I actually think it sounds great. But im no audiophile, so im able to enjoy it.

I recommend this if you want more of an Original Experience. You are getting the PS1 game, not a PS1 game that was re-mastered to modern PC standards. You can remap buttons if you prefer. I am playing with a Razor X-Box controller and have no issues and I recommend a controller because its what the game was designed around. The game is the same game, all the good and the bad that was in the original. But the extras are where it shines.

You can choose to add fake save game data from games like Silent Hill or Castlevania, but I wont spoil why. (Even though the game is old, plenty of new gamers may be experiencing this for the first time. Especially given its status as a legendary game) 

The Master Book and the Screen Play Book that are included is really cool for fans of the series. It offers in depth information about the choices involved with the game design and what inspired the story and characters. Plus a list of all the hidden content and how to find it.

You also get the VR Missions which is more like a side expansion pack and access to a regional exclusive version with Intergrel. You can choose to download the European or Japanese versions of the game too should you want to experience those. 

Overall, I am glad that I can experience the Original vision of Metal Gear Solid on Steam. I am thankful for it, as I thought I would never have that chance. Here's hoping Vol. 2 comes out and they bring Peace Walker, Acid, Portable Ops, and Ghost Bable into the mix so I (and others) can experience the full series story.","","true","1703817370","1704185484","true","0","1","0.523809552192687988","false"

There are many, many problems with this game. First, the controls make combat and boss battles a struggle more against the bad controls than the enemies. Revolver Ocelot is simply not fun to fight. Sniper Wolf is not fun. Grey Fox is not fun. Psycho Mantis is interesting as a gimmick, but still not fun. The Metal Gear boss battle in particular feels awful. Second, the stealth mechanics are quite limited compared to later entries in the series, and compared to other stealth games series, such as Thief, Deus Ex, and Splinter Cell. Third, the look of the game is...dated. Yes, yes, I know this game is old enough to run for government office in many countries, but Konami hasn't done anything to at least make the textures and models look a little less blocky and ugly. Fourth, the story, characters, and dialogue feature all of the trademark Kojima bullshit. You'll be forced into combat when you just want to sneak, and you'll have to listen to characters monologue about their dumb plans and contradictory ideas. 

I enjoyed some of my time with this game, even though I rage quit during the metal gear battle. If you have a high tolerance for Kojima's bullshit, give it a try. Otherwise, please play MGS 2 or 3, or V.","","true","1703728561","1709036898","false","0","0","0.454545468091964722","false"

I was 8 and I wanted to play the main game so badly. It wouldn’t be till 2005 till I got to play the full game and beat it. So many great memories. The story, dialogue, music, and fun comes back in full force and even with the graphics of yester-year.
It pains me a little to see it as Mixed review status at the of writing this. It runs great on my laptop when I struggle to run most modern games.

The Good
[+] Storytelling at it’s best. One of the best entries in the series. Nostalgia at it’s finest.
[+] So good to hear David Hayter’s voice as Snake again after all these years.
[+] Pulse-pounding, edge of the seat stealth action. Classic. Easy to pick up, difficult to master.
[+] Plenty of Easter Eggs I’m still finding even after all these years.

The Meh
[/] Some things aren’t well defined in this port like finding Meryl’s codec number since there’s not box copy to see it on the back, or switching the controller port during the Mantis fight. Guides exist, but I feel it could’ve been easier to pick up on.
[/] The game mostly aged well, but it can be easy to get stun-locked when multiple enemies attack
[/] Hind D fight still takes longer than it should. During the phase where the chopper hides, sometimes it takes a few minutes before it reappears.

The Bad
(I got nothing. I love this game an all its flaws)","","true","1703657423","1708723913","true","0","2","0.533898293972015381","false"

The plot is clever and interesting while not being so complex you'll need to book a school essay just to summarize it unlike later games.

The voice acting is great.

The easter eggs are giving the 4:th wall the middle finger.

The cutscenes are long enough to do your laundry in yet keep you hooked even the 1000:th time.

The controlls sucks ass (regardless with controller or keyboard) just like our god Kojima intended.

On one hand, MGS is one of the best franchises in gaming and it's awesome for preservation to have them on PC. On the other hand, these ports are so lazy when it comes to in-game features, even for Konami. While some features indicate that people who worked on this did care at some level, such as the pseudo memory card for the Psycho Mantis battle, the massive lack of graphic options is honestly baffling. I did not expect a full-blown remake like Twin Snakes, but the games are as bare-bones as they could be, not even a small resolution upscale, both 2 and 3 are 720p only
I'll still leave a positive review due to the quality of the games alone and how they are well deserved of a playthrough even in this botched form, but the port is so lackluster, they could at the very least had 4 and PW included to soften the blow.

In fact, it's because of the rumors of this exact port popping up a few years ago that I got impatient and just emulated them in the first place. These ports are by no means ideal, especially for people who played with significantly better software to enhance the visuals and controls and fix any bugs or graphical errors. The Master Collection is rather barebones, not all that changed from the original releases of the games it repackages and your best experience with it is tied to having access to performance and graphic-enhancing mods. I will recommend this just because I can't put a ""mixed"" rating because it's so neutral. [/b] |||

The Metal Gear series has become pretty special to me over several months last year in which I tried out every major installment it had to offer, but the first Solid game might just still be my favorite of the bunch. It's one of the most impressive PS1 games I've played and it's so well shot and voice acted, and the mechanics are in depth enough that if it wasn't so obviously retro in controls and artstyle you could confuse the core design as modern. Most of that's owed to Kojima and his Kubrick-like whipping of his own dev team, lol. He strived for a unique experience at the time, and it still is now. 

I'm not 100% on the details of the franchise's story, since it's infamously convoluted at times, but I remember enough to give a somewhat accurate synopsis of the story.

Metal Gear Solid 1 for the Playstation 1 (1998) is the direct sequel to Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake (1990) and follows FOXHOUND operative Solid Snake's return into espionage, albeit against his will. For the better part of 6 years he spent his days in the Alaskan wilderness training sled dogs, when he was ""requested"" by the US government to fulfill one last mission before he can retire-- infiltrate a secret nuclear weapon production facility on Shadow Moses island and  prevent his former FOXHOUND comrades' insurrection against the United States as well as destroy their bipedal nuclear-capable tank, Metal Gear REX. 

It's one of the first 3D stealth games and one of the first games to have overtly cinematic cutscenes and plots. Gameplay largely takes place in the nuclear weapons facility, where you control Solid Snake and make your way through various zones trying not to get detected. 
You're outfitted with a comms device called the Codec which you can access with Select which lets you contact allies to get context-sensitive (usually specific locations in the map) advice regarding bosses, areas, puzzles, or interesting dialogue or trivia. One contact in particular acts as your save system, which is practically mandatory but can be overlooked. IIRC you can press the down button on the D-pad to access a list of your contacts rather than have to punch in the specific frequencies for their channels. 
You also use two inventories by holding L2 and R2, one for items/powerups and one for weapons. Items can range from mine detectors, infra-red goggles, nightvis goggles, EMP grenades to consumables like rations (your health kits in the game). The weapon inventory is comparatively more straightforward. 
Your combat options range from said firearm menu with guns and grenades to a simple melee combat string that knocks enemies down (circle for PS) and strangling/neck-snapping (square for PS). That's really as complex as the combat gets. It doesn't change all that much across the first 4 games. 
Espionage meanwhile has you crawling through vent ducts (tap X (for PS controllers) to enter a crouch stance then move to start crawling). You can press up against walls to hide and tap your strangle button to knock on it to attract enemies to your location. You're given a minimap to see enemy vision cones and to display other hazards such as mines should you have the corresponding items (mine detector) equipped. Lastly, you can shimmy while hanging and walk along ledges with your back to the wall to access otherwise inaccessible areas. Much of the challenge comes from knowing what items to use at what time to clear rooms, though it isn't really that hard. 

The game's story is the age-old ""jaded veteran carves his own path after being used by his superiors"" trope with a small bit of romance. Solid Snake is essentially blackmailed into undergoing one last mission for the government he used to serve. He's to infiltrate Shadow Moses Island and rescue two government VIP's, the DARPA chief Donald Anderson and ArmsTech president Kenneth Baker from his former comrades-turned-rogue-insurgents from FOXHOUND, and stop them from using a walking nuclear tank called Metal Gear to nuke the US if they don't give them an enormous ransom sum and the body of Big Boss. Snake makes his way through the island's tightly-guarded facilities battling tanks, avoiding turrets and encountering the many quirky FOXHOUND insurgent bosses, all codenamed after animals and being very unique in gameplay from eachother. Multiple plot twists are revealed throughout the game- that one of Snake's old war buddies, Frank Yeager (from Metal Gear 1 and 2), survived a fatal battle and was remade into a cyborg and is tearing up the facility. His former superior Roy Campbell's daughter Meryl has snuck onto the island without his knowledge and he wants her back home safe. Another of his allies is the sister of Frank and vowed revenge against Snake for nearly killing her brother and manufactured a virus that'll eventually kill him as a result. Lastly, the leader of the uprising, Liquid Snake, is Solid's biological brother, and they are both clones of his mentor and father-figure Big Boss made to replace him, and Liquid wants to kill all of them to prove his worthiness. Solid ends up befriending one of the lead engineers behind the Metal Gear, Hal Emmerich (nicknamed Otacon) along the way, which blooms into a strong friendship in the future. 

There's nothing that can really be said about Metal Gear Solid 1 that hasn't already been said. It's a pretty legendary game, but the franchise has kind of fallen into obscurity. Nonetheless, it's still a good play even 25 years after its' release. If you don't mind the janky controls (which honestly aren't that bad compared to other games of their time), it's worth the time. 

[u] As for the port itself.. it's serviceable, but for Metal Gear fans who've been left starving for content for over 8 years (Survive doesn't exist), it leaves much to be desired. The controls have a slight input delay and the graphics and resolution could be much better, but instead they're placed in a simple emulator. As usual, mods come to save the day as you can probably solve most of those issues just by tweaking it that way. [/u]

Overall, never thought I'd get to write a review for any of the older MGS games on Steam, but I'm delighted that I was wrong. Cheers.","","false","1702994535","1704164434","true","0","3","0.532908737659454346","false"

With that said, I've been having a blast. If you're looking to experience the series for the first time or revisit it, this collection gives so much great content to dive into. While the older titles (MG1 and MG2) don't hold up nearly as well, the Solid series have become some of my favorite games through experiencing it through this package.

This is NOT the original PC version, which they had on GOG for YEARS before removing, meaning that certain speedrunning tech is physically not possible and the keyboard controls... well they're somehow even worse than the original PC release. Kinda sad to say that, but I expect literally NOTHING out of modern Konami, so I guess this is kinda what I thought it would be.","","true","1702466211","1702466211","true","0","1","0.519999980926513672","false"

visually and gameplay wise Metal Gear Solid 1 is like many games of it's era , the visuals are simplistic and the control feel a bit stiff and robotic yet it's overall good enough to justify trying or replaying it this many years after it's original release. it's got a decent story which is delivered very well with it's vibrant voice actors. The sountrack is also very Iconic and help making this game way more immersive then it would possibily have been otherwise.

the controls are clunky and weird but with practice you'l eventually get used to how they work , they're at least functional and responsive. some weapon actually shoot when you release the weapon button and some of them like the socom will have snake track the target that cross it's pointer laser when holding that button.

the enemies are not the smartest tool in the shed but they're consistent in their behavior , they can ear some of the noises you make , they can see your trace if there is snow and they all follow a specific routine , they do force you to think before you act and you're rewarded for not bruteforcing your way in and avoid being noticed. they're just smart enough to make the game work the way it was intended and that's fine , this games was original meant for pretty limited hardwares and metal gear solid offer a lot's despite this fact.

the difficulty can be adjusted and if you're not familiar with metal gear I recommend starting with easy for your first time.

the VR missions are included and they offer some very interesting challenges as well and you get levels built on every weapons featured in the main game on top of some extra and very interesting puzzles level , they're also very useful to learn how the game and it's various mechanism work too.","","true","1702354996","1702355185","true","0","1","0.519774019718170166","false"

- The story and characters are fantastic, they're the best part of the game.
- Gameplay feels great most of the time (some hits in combat do feel cheap sometimes though), but there is a very noticeable ~0.5 sec input delay. You'll get used to it but actions that require precision (sniper, guided missile [spoiler]and the fist fight with Liquid at the end[/spoiler]) feel very clunky.
- Audio glitches sometimes, mostly in conversations.
- The game is stuck in a lower resolution, you can play it in full screen but it will have borders.

Still, even with those issues I would highly recommend the game. I think if you like stealth games you need to play this at some point in your life.","","true","1702151314","1702151541","true","0","0","0","false"

Definitely download the North American language pack so you can play it at its full frame rate, should be default but at least the option is there.

This game is a masterpiece and should be played at least once by anyone interested in MGS, Kojima, or nostalgic PS1 games.

This game not being able to be uninstalled being one. Whether or not this is a Steam or Konami issue, that is up for debate, but I am struggling to remove this off my PC.

Secondly, I wouldn't be uninstalling if the games weren't of a ridiculous size! 

To get these emulated, you can do so without using as much as 5gb of space, with emulators.

These are the same games, no changes, no updates (apart from modern controls).

For convenience sake, it is nice having them all available on Steam. 

Financially and logistically with HDD space, this does not make any sense to purchase.

I have no choice but to give a yes or no answer to recommend this game. 

I would otherwise be mixed, but given it is MGS on Steam, I will be recommending this game as long as you are willing to accept the costs.","","true","1701669039","1701669039","true","0","1","0.523809552192687988","false"

I will say that the graphics are severely dated now, it really needs some kind of 4k remaster, it only seems to run in 720p or maybe lower, not sure. It looks rough as hell, it has some sort or upscale filter that looks awful, though I was able to improve the visuals and make it more playable with the aforementioned mod and reshade that is available on Nexus that adds scan lines. It still looks rough however. The control scheme was always a bit finicky and this hasn't changed, you can use the analogue sticks. I'm playing with Xbox controller, this seems to be a criticism in many reviews, but it must of been updated. I don't really have any major input lag, so this may also have been fixed. Definitely more than playable. One of my all time favorite games and brings back many memories from my youth. I recommend it, was totally ahead of its time. I plan to replay all of the games.

Gonna be completely honest here, I'm just happy they brought the first few MGS games to PC and modern consoles in the first place instead of deciding to drop a bunch of remakes and going on with their day, leaving the classics in the dust.

If you're not too bothered with the lower resolution and want a classic MGS1 experience, I'd recommend it, the story holds up extremely well even now and ngl ""The Best Is Yet To Come"" has not left my playlist once since I finished this game, finishing this game created a connection to that song that touched my soul.","","true","1701223136","1701223136","true","3","27","0.68944096565246582","false"

This rerelease is an emulated version of the PS1 original developed by M2, and while there are a few issues with it that I'm hopeful could get fixed in a patch (lack of analogue controls and a weird stutter thing I've been getting are the ones that come to mind) I feel a lot of the complaints are a bit kind of just ""upset that this isn't something else"". Like, it's an emulation of the PS1 original, complete with low resolution and all the weird playstation texture filtering going on. That's totally fine, that's how it was on the PS1. Sure you could run some sort of higher resolution renderer, but honestly I am not sure that actually looks good - like the PC port that GOG sells basically does that, and I don't know if that's necessarily an objectively ""better"" look for the game as such - like the higher screen resolution just looks out of place with the low-res and low-poly assets. And if you start worrying about like filtering or upscaling the assets, then we're getting a bit revisionist and I'm really hesitant about the idea of Konami doing that without Kojima around. But in general like there's nothing wrong with presenting games in an emulated form running in their original resolution.

To be honest, game is excellent and this is a totally OK way to play it, and here's hoping they patch the few minor issues. They've fixed some already so fingers crossed.","","true","1701071250","1701071250","true","0","0","0","false"

I've tested it against the original PS1 version of this game, and there's an incredible amount of inconsistencies with all guards in the game.

For example, if you approach a guard in a 45-degree angle from behind, the guard will spot you - despite this not being present in the original. Additionally, in this version the guards do not respond consistently. This means that you can approach guards from the correct side, but still be punished because of a bug.

I've completed multiple PS1 perfect runs, that is, runs with 0 deaths and 0 alerts (besides the 3 required alerts during the game) - yet I was unable to consistently be undiscovered in the sewers - the very first room of the game.

I suspected something was wrong with the difficulty - perhaps ""Hard"" was the European extreme difficulty from the EU releases, which are notoriously difficult. But after further testing this doesn't seem to be the case.

My best guess, is that the guard' ai follow your CPU' speed, not the FPS in the game.

If you want to test it yourself, start the game on Normal or Hard. Then wait for the VERY FIRST guard to turn away from you - he'll turn east and you have the opportunity to grab him. Doing so is extremely inconsistent - he'll sometimes spot you before you even approach and sometimes in the middle of grabbing him.

I love Metal Gear Solid, but this is outright unplayable for advanced players.","","true","1701025999","1702449122","false","0","8","0.513376474380493164","false"

This game's natural internal resolution is 240p stretched on a 1080p screen.

Emulators have the ability to increase internal resolution from 240p to internal resolution of 2160p

This game is ran by an emulator which have options to DRAMATICALLY increase the graphics or controls by roughly 12,000 times.

We are given no options. The stick is mapped as a DPAD which is not even onpar with what was done on PS1 back in the day.

It could be easily enhanced by anyone, anywhere, at any time.

Lazy port, as usual and as expected from Konami.","","true","1701019945","1701020201","false","1","3","0.452702701091766357","false"

[h1]Introduction[/h1]
[b]This review is based on playing on the Steam deck.[/b]
At long last, PC gamers can experience the legend with the arrival of the Metal Gear Solid – Master Collection. This review is for the first game in the Solid saga, which began in 1998 on the PlayStation 1. I want to rectify misguided assumptions about this release by saying this game is not a remaster. It is simply a reboxed version of the HD collection. And with no further delay, let us discover if the legend holds any weight or if this legacy is all just a myth.

🟩 Fun and intuitive boss fights that push you to adapt to overcome the challenges.

🟩 Stealth and combat are incredibly fluid, allowing you to slip in and out of the mechanics effortlessly. [/td]

[h1]Story[/h1]

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3078121384

It's 2005, and FOXHOUND (a genetically enhanced special forces unit) seized control of a remote island in Alaska, utilised to house a nuclear weapons disposal facility codenamed ""Shadow Moses"". The members of FOXHOUND have threatened to deploy a nuclear-capable walking battle tank that was being discreetly tested within the installation and unleash its full nuclear capability against the United States if the demands of FOXHOUND are not met, in the form of retrieval of the remains of Big Boss and a ransom of 1 billion dollars within 24 hours.

With the deadline set, the US government, under the guise of Colonel Roy Campbell, had no choice but to force the legendary Solid Snake out of retirement to infiltrate the facility and locate and rescue the captive hostages: DARPA Chief Donald Anderson and Armstech President Kenneth Baker and some way to deactivate or destroy the nuclear-capable tank, Metal Gear Rex before it has a chance to launch its missiles.

This is iconic Metal Gear Solid, an intriguing plot surrounded by complex ideas and unanswered questions. The general story is well-written and provides valuable insight into the state of the world and what Snake has done in service to his country. With that said, you can't ignore the fact the story doesn't seem to flow naturally and sudden character introductions consistently stifle you into further confusion rather than alleviate it.

I recommend people interested in the story look up the plot and timeline of events and who everyone is once they have completed the game.

[h1]Gameplay Analysis[/h1]
[h3]I can't believe I'm being hit on by the famous Solid Snake[/h3]
Despite its significant age, I'd argue that Metal Gear Solid is among the most mechanically gratifying titles ever released.

Being well ahead of its time, mechanics such as leaving footprints behind that guards can use to tail and locate you and utilising cigarette smoke to see lasers are simple yet under-utilised ideas even by today's standards.

But Metal Gear Solid doesn't excel because of its gimmick mechanics. It is because the entire game has been built to be an experience, from the diverse boss encounters that push you to overcome tremendous hurdles to the simple task of avoiding guard patrols that react to sights, sounds and events in their surroundings.

[h3]Snake? SNAKE? SNAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKE?![/h3]
Stealth plays the primary role in MGS1, and your main focus for much of the campaign will be to remain hidden and unseen by everyone by any means necessary.

Stealth can be accomplished in multiple ways, such as hiding behind walls and waiting for an opening in the patrol or by more amusing means, like the iconic cardboard box technique.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3078101996

Thankfully, the minimap can and will greatly assist you in remaining hidden, providing you with enemy locations, the direction they are viewing as well as many other things such as mine locations and security cameras.

Should your best attempt to hide in a cardboard fruit box in the middle of a factory floor fail the brilliant mind of the legendary Solid Snake, you always have the alternative of combat. You can fist-fight soldiers to make space to escape, or as a last resort, pull out your guns and battle them that way.

Both of these outcomes do have consequences, however, as once the game is over, you are allocated a rating based on your performance, where the less you're seen and the lower your kill count, the higher your score will be, which is vital for 100% completion of this game.

[h3]Impressive, Snake![/h3]
On top of the base game, there is additional content for those interested in pursuing it.
The script book allows you to read through the entirety of the game dialogue in script format.
The master book provides valuable insight into the world and allows you to read up on the events of MGS.
And lastly, you can complete Special and VR missions that are essentially bonus missions and a training mode to hone your already considerable talents.

[h1]Audio and Visual[/h1]
The master collection version of MGS1 leaves players wanting a more aesthetically pleasing experience. Not much has changed from its original format from a visual standpoint, and it is both nostalgia-inducing and a bit disappointing, especially for a title PC gamers have been waiting for.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3078103166

The audio is the same, but it always was set to a higher standard than its visual counterpart.

[h1]Deck Performance and Specifications[/h1]
Metal Gear Solid is a game well over a decade old and worked as well as expected considering the hardware and had a consistently low battery usage from start to finish, allowing me about 5-6 hours of game time from a full charge.

[h1]Final Thoughts - Good[/h1]
[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2529084785]Review chart here.[/url]
Not exactly the game I was hoping for, to be entirely honest, but it's still a pleasant surprise to have the entire nostalgic trilogy on PC at long last. With very few graphical improvements and no tuning to the game engine to make it operate better, this is, as I mentioned earlier, just an HD collection of the games and not a remaster. Likely worth it if you've never played the game before or are itching for a trip down memory lane, and even better if you can get it at a discount.

Lo bueno, es el mismo juegazo, gran historia, buenos personajes, villanos emblemáticos, las locuras que siempre se le ocurren a Kojima, ademas tiene contenido adicional: el libro de historia y el guion completo del juego y otras versiones del titulo (todo esto en ingles). Lo malo, es el mismo juego, no hubo prácticamente nada de trabajo, ninguna mejora ni visual ni de calidad de vida, lo único que podes configurar es que marco queres que te muestre en vez de las franjas negras y que juegos de Konami queres simular tener cargados en la tarjeta de memoria (recordemos, es un juego de PS1). Para salir del juego tienen que pulsar R1 y L1 (no se olviden de guardar antes).  
Es un juego muy recomendable si queres revivir (ahora de manera legal en PC) una gloria del pasado que todavía aguanta el tiempo o si nunca lo jugaste para que puedas entender porque es que Kojima es considerado un grande de la industria; pero no podemos saltear que es un paquete que se siente muy poco trabajado, que existe solo por el afán de sacar dinero rápido con un nombre. Como mencione antes, por si mismo y todo lo que fue y es, lo recomiendo fuertemente, pero tampoco por ello voy a dejar de criticar a Konami porque podría habernos ofrecido más.","","true","1700878579","1700878579","true","0","1","0","false"

Don't get me wrong: MGS is a great game, a fantastic one even. And when it comes to quantity, this release truly delivers the goods: Every conceivable release of MGS is included, with all the old dubbed versions and VR missions.

But quality-wise? This is as barebones as it gets. The changes to the PSone original are miniscule at best and the game doesn't even take advantage of the PC platform by at least sharpen out all the edges and smooth some textures. 
While I LOVE MGS, I can't recommend this version. There are other ways to get a better experience playing on PC.","","true","1700858528","1700858528","false","0","9","0.617289721965789795","false"

Everything good about this was created by Hideo Kojima and the original developers, such a classic and plays just as you remember it, nostalgia hits all over the place, memories flooding back and way ahead of its time.

Everything bad is, well, obviously down to Konami, they could have actually put some effort into these releases, maybe remastered them in some way or at least add some quality of life things...like audio sliders. But they didn't, the bare minimum has been achieved, and they're lucky that the bare minimum is still the fantastic game!","","false","1700786519","1700786519","true","0","0","0","false"

El juego mantiene muchos problemas, algunos antiguos y otros nuevos, se deben explicar porque cuando uno no conoce el juego la compra puede ser una mala experiencia si no se mantienen en consideración. 

Los gráficos son adecuados para un modo pantalla de 4:3 y si se juega en pantalla completa en FHD o UHD el nivel de pixelado es bastante alto, incluso mayor al juego original en televisores de la época. La captura de imágenes puede entrar en un ciclo que no para de crear retratos, sacando entre 20 y 100 antes de parar, se soluciona al cambiar de escena. Los antiguos no fueron solucionados, la saturación del audio es notoria y molesta. También no solo es recomendado jugarlo con un control sino que no es posible configurar adecuadamente el juego para usar el teclado y el mouse, lo que no solo evidencia nula modificación sino que es una limitante que debe estar claro en la tienda, no muchos mantienen controles de videojuegos para PC. Termino con que el cambio de conector se realiza a través de un menú nuevo ""de pausa"" que no aparece al presionar pausa sino que entra en conjunción de botones. No es mala la idea para mantener todo fiel al original pero se puede hacer uno adecuado y otra versión untoched, parecido a las ediciones cinematográficas si ese es el objetivo. Parece falta de trabajo y no tanto preservacionismo.

Muchos pensábamos que veríamos la cara de Raven, o lo que se escondía bajo la máscara de mantis. No existe trabajo de restauración ni adaptación y eso queda de la percepción de los usuarios, es un lanzamiento para los fanáticos que probablemente lo tienen en otras plataformas y ya lo jugaron.

Entre no tener nada y esta versión, es una buena adición a la biblioteca. Esperaremos que en algún momento alguien se atreva a remasterizarlo con gráficos MGSV y fiel a la historia original, obviamente.

Metal Gear Solid is one of the best games ever made. It might possibly be the best game ever made and one that Kojima has not ever topped. I love this game quite a bit, which is why I am so disappointed at what Konami has released here. This ""port"" (emulation) is a technical mess. From the moment I booted up the game, I immediately started having problems. FPS drops, bad audio, no emulation of the analog stick. How is this supposed to be the ""Master Collection"" when every other option to play this game is better. Out of the main 3 games in the collection, I at least expected this one to play nicely. Konami has once again shown that they just don't care. I would continue to ramble on about this game along with MGS 2 and MGS 3, which both have their own problems, but it just isn't worth my time. I suggest buying a PS3 along with the MGS Legacy Collection to experience the games in a much better, yet somewhat flawed (Bluepoint Collection) manner.","","false","1700644723","1700644723","false","0","1","0","false"

E sendo fã da franquia eu digo o seguinte, só compre a coletanea se vc realmente puder, o port com certeza é bem melhor que o do seu antecessor mas ainda tem muuuito a ser consertado e ajeitado, tem uns bugs aqui e ali e não entendo pq não dá pra alterar as configurações gráficas. E, na minha opinião, os jogos estão rodando bem melhor que em um emulador. 
Dito isso, essa coletanea está a um preço muito injusto e eu não recomendo pegar agora nem a preço cheio, tem muita coisa pra ser ajeitada e apesar de ser jogavél, esperar é uma opção que pode ser mais viavél. Porém se tu se sentir muito curioso ou só quiser revisitar a franquia mesmo, é por sua conta e risco.

As I have already written about the launcher for this collection in my review of the two MSX Metal Gear games, I will simply say that I'm quite happy with what they have pulled off with the launcher and it works great.

[h3]Section 2: Game Versions and Technical Info[/h3]
First and foremost I should mention that this game and most of the Metal Gear Solid series excluding V would be best enjoyed with a controller, up until Ground Zeroes they really were all developed with PlayStation in mind.
While it is still necessary to use alt+enter to switch between windowed and fullscreen modes, updates to this title have added some basic emulator features including a toggle for smoothing, upscaling modes & forced widescreen, and a CRT filter. A volume slider is also available which oddly was not present at launch.
As for the content available, primarily Metal Gear Solid's launcher allows the player to choose between four different versions of the game:
[olist][*]Metal Gear Solid
The original Metal Gear Solid is the one that most people have experienced, by default this collection provides the European version of the game which is the one that I have personally played the most over the years, a quirk with old technical standards for televisions in Europe means that the European version of the game runs at a lower framerate than intended and has less responsive controls, for that reason I would not recommend playing this version of the game.
I would instead recommend selecting the ""Download"" option on the first menu of the launcher and installing the North American option, this will give you the option of ""English (US)"" as a language upon selecting the game, this version of the game is both entirely in English and also runs at the intended 30fps.

[*]Metal Gear Solid: Special Missions
This disc is separate from the main story of MGS, and purely includes extra challenge missions to play through, ""Special Missions"" is the European version of this disc

[*]Metal Gear Solid: VR Missions
VR Missions is the North American version of the Special Missions disc, for the framerate reasons I mentioned above I would recommend this one, though at the moment I believe the achievement for clearing this game is bugged if you care about that sort of thing.

[*]Metal Gear Solid: Integral
Not to be confused with the shoddy 2000 port of Metal Gear Solid to Windows that we saw in the west, this title is an expanded version of the original MGS that was released in 1999 exclusively to Japan, this version includes a number of additional features including more completion bonuses, difficulty options, and the content of the above VR Missions discs in Japanese. This version features mostly Japanese text but with English voice acting.
While it has the most content of all game versions I would not suggest this for a first playthrough as you may miss out on subtitles and somewhat important item descriptions.
[/olist]

[h3]Section 3: Metal Gear Solid (1998)[/h3]
This was the first game in the series for many and is widely agreed to be the best starting point, in terms of gameplay it does largely rehash elements from Metal Gear 2 but with what at the time could be considered cutting edge 3d technology, a dynamic camera that mostly stays overhead but adjusts contextually to peer around corners, a first person option for some weapons, motion captured animation for characters with impressive visual effects like visible breath from NPCs in the cold Alaskan air, puddle and glass reflections, and footprints on snowy surfaces. The game also includes stereo CD audio with convincing reverb (largely covering up how compressed all of the sound effects are), and a soundtrack that while still sounding pretty MIDI-ish is super unique and memorable.
For the most part this game does try to improve upon the existing elements of the previous game in the series, but there are some odd quirks the player will have to get used to, needing to stand a very specific distance away from a guard to be able to choke him out without him magically setting off an alert while your arms are around his neck, being mostly rooted to the spot and relying on autoaim to shoot at enemies while requiring an obtuse button combination to move while shooting which only allows you to fire straight forward are two that spring to mind.
While there are some callbacks to Snake's past in the events of the MSX games, this game tells its own story and sets up its own plot points that are completely vital to the rest of the series, especially this game's follow up Sons of Liberty.
For all of these reviews I would like to avoid talking about the plot but rest assured it is fantastic, though do expect to have the gameplay constantly interrupted for codec calls, these can be skipped on repeat playthroughs but you would do well to soak in everything for your first time through.

In addition to main story content are the VR missions discs that I mentioned in the previous section, these are 300 fairly short and greatly varied scenarios, while they begin with basic sneaking and weapon courses, you are later introduced to situations more tight and intricately designed than anything seen in the main game.
These scenarios are all pure uninterrupted gameplay, and for those who are not just here for the story they are the most fun part of the game.

[h3]Section 4: [strike]Gene[/strike] Extras[/h3]
As with other parts of this collection, a master book and screenplay book can be selected from the launcher.
The master book has pages for each character in the series and their involvement in each game as well as a summary of pretty much everything that happens in the series including some explanations of things that some players may have missed. The master book is really great but do NOT read this until you have finished all of the mainline games or you will definitely be spoiled.
For the screenplay book they have transcribed every piece of dialogue in the game including all possible codec conversations, it has over 500 pages!

[h3]Section 5: Conclusion[/h3]
Overall this game really is one of those must-play titles for any gamer to be listed alongside Ocarina of Time and Half-Life, it requires absolutely no prior series knowledge to appreciate and while ambitious feels super tight and polished as a mechanically top-down stealth game, outside of the unforgettable boss battles there are only a handful of mandatory combat encounters which while far from perfect given the game's shooting controls should not feel too frustrating for those playing on the normal difficulty setting.","","true","1700602630","1707059368","true","0","0","0","false"

It takes place six years after Meal Gear 2: Solid Snake, who is a secret agent that has to infiltrate Shadow Moses, which is a secret base that was captured by Fox Hound, who is holding the United States hostage for the remains of Big Boss, who is the same guy as Solid Snake except with a eyepatch. Solid snake, not Big Boss, sneaks into the air vent to save DARPA Chief, but then he dies, so you fight a man called Revolver Ocelot, but your duel is interrupted by a mysterious ninja, called Grey Fox, who is a man called Frank Jaeger, who used to be in Fox Hound, but then defected to Zanzibarland because he was in love with a former figure skater from Czechoslovakia. Because he is a robot, he has to cut off Revolver Ocelot's hand. Then Snake finds a peeing man called Otacon, who is the son of a famous scientist that killed himself because his second wife cheated on him with his own son. You see, Otacon's father, Huey Emmerich built Metal Gear Zeke for Naked Snake and then built Metal Gear Sahelanthropist for a man called Skull Face. This is why Otacon builds a secret robot called Metal Gear Rex for a man called Liquid Snake, who is a clone of Solid Snake, created from the DNA of Big Boss, who is also known as Naked Snake, who is both of their fathers, and, he has an eye patch. Solid Snake is tricked into activating Metal Gear because Cambell thought that Miller was NOT Liquid Snake, but he actually was, but, turns out, Revolver Ocelot was actually a double agent the entire time, and was secretly working for the third Snake Brother, called Solidus Snake, who is also the President of the United States, and has a Dr. Octupus suit with flamethrowers on it, and, he has an eye patch. Are you following me so far? Next we have Metal Gear Solid 2, this is where things start to get a little confusing. 2 years after Shadow Moses, Solid Snake jumps onto a boat where he is confronted by Revolver Ocelot, and it turns out, he is now possessed by the spirit of Liquid Snake because he grafted Liquid's arm onto his body, so now Ocelot is voiced acted by the voice actor for Liquid Snake and he blows up the entire boat and steals an all-new robot called Metal Gear Ray. Then 2 years later, the new president is taken hostage by the old president, so the Colonel sends in Snake, who is actually Raiden, who is a part of Fox Hound, but not the old Fox Hound, a new version.Turns out, Solid Snake is the leader of the terrorists, but not the real Solid Snake, who is now known as Pliskin, you see, after you rescue the new president, he reveals that the entire democratic process is actually a sham staged by a secret organization called The Patriots, who rule the United States from the shadows, turns out, Big Shell is actually a facade, merely created to conceal a super-secret robot fortress hidden beneath it, called Arsenal Gear, which houses a powerful AI, called GW, which allows The Patriots to censor and control the flow of information. To stop GW, Raiden teams up with Otacon's sister, who is killed by a vampire. After they upload the virus to Arsenal Gear, The Colonel tells Raiden to turn the game off, because he was actually an AI construct created by GW the entire time. Raiden then has to fight 25 Metal Gear Rays on foot with a pistol. After the battle, Liquid Ocelot reveals that he was actually a triple agent working for The Patriots all along. Turns out the entire video game of Metal Gear Solid 2 was orchestrated by The Patriots to simulate the events of metal Gear Solid 1 so that Raiden could get good army training. Ocelot is once again possessed by Liquid Snake who declares he is now a reverse quadruple agent and will destroy The Patriots and jumps off of a building. Then for no reason, the AI Colonel contacts Raiden and reveals that GW was only one of many AIs developed by The Patriots, the TRUE purpose of the simulation was to serve as a microcosm of society entering into the digital age, The Patriots were concerned that with the arrival of the internet, humanity would become too fixated on trivial information like overly complicated video game story-lines. Then we have Metal Gear Solid 3, which is set 41 years before Metal Gear Solid 1. Big Boss is betrayed by The Boss, who is a different person, but he doesn't know that she was only pretending to defect to Russia because the United States told her to do that so she could be a scapegoat for the Cold War. After being thrown off of a bridge, Naked Snake is tasked with destroying an early Metal Gear prototype, called Shagohod, and eliminating Colonel Volgin, who has lightning powers, and eliminating The Boss, who he is in love with. And he has to steal a secret micro film that is worth one hundred billion dollars. He teams up with a woman called EVA, also known as Tachiana, also known as Matka Pluku, also known as Big Mama, who is Solid Snake's mother, who, in a shocking twist, is actually revealed to be a double agent working for China, and she steals the microfilm, but, it was a fake. Then, in Metal Gear Solid V, you play as Venom Snake.
Metal Gear Solid 4. The real Colonel brings Solid Snake out of retirement for the fourth time, even though he is now 200 years old. His mission is to stop Liquid Ocelot once and for all, the only problem is that Metal Gears have now merged with the technology of a cow, so he has to meet Drebin, who has a little monkey. Drebin injects Snake with nano-machines so that he can shoot guns and learns that Liquid's new plan is to use Big Boss's bio-metric data as a key to take sole command of The Patriots firearms control system. The vampire working for Liquid then throws Big Boss's comatose body into a fire because he forgot what the story-line was, then everybody goes back to Shadow Moses, where Liquid reveals his new battleship called Outer Heaven, which is the name of the secret base where Solid Snake blew up Big Boss with a rocket launcher 19 years ago. Snake sneaks into the core of Outer Heaven, which is actually a modified version of Arsenal Gear and installs a secret virus that disables the entire AI network perpetrated by The Patriots, thus de-activating all weapons in the entire world, but, turns out, this was actually all a part of Revolver Ocelot's plan the entire time, you see, he was never actually possessed by Liquid Snake, he merely used hypnotherapy to make himself think that he was; his true goal all along was to achieve world peace but also, he wants to fight Solid Snake in a brawl to the death, you see, Big Boss was actually Revolver Ocelot's greatest friend and idol, even though he killed his mom. During their fight, Ocelot is exposed to the FoxDie virus, which kills him, because it was injected into Snake by Drebin, even though he should have been exposed to it earlier in the game and died, but they forgot. And THAT is the entire story line of Metal Gear Solid.
BUT THEN IN A SURPRISE CUT-SCENE, IT IS REVEALED BY BIG BOSS, WHO IS STILL ALIVE, THAT EVERY SINGLE EVENT IN THE ENTIRE SERIES WAS FAKE, AND STAGED BY THE SHADOW PATRIOTS, YOU SEE, TURNS OUT, E E Y O R E.","","true","1700591383","1700591383","true","0","0","0","false"

Game is stuck to the original PSX resolution with a shitty bilinear filter on top.

Storia, personaggi, musiche, gameplay, dialoghi... tutto come allora, tutto da rivivere tornando a Shadow Moses.
A strisciare nei condotti dell'aria... a farci leggere la mente da Mantis... a correre su per le scale... a fare a pugni con il Ninja... a romperci le dita per resistere alla tortura (usate un cucchiaio!!)... a piangere per Wolf abbracciata al suo psg1... a seguire le istruzioni di Master Miller per raffreddare e scaldare schede pal... a distruggere il Rex...

Dettagli Tecnici:
La Master Collection ha il pregio di aver portato su pc un capolavoro da troppo tempo intrappolato su conosole obsolete o emulatori barbini, ma non è tutto oro quel che luccica...
Konami ha implementato diverse funzioni carine, ma ha lasciato indietro diversi difetti tecnici piuttosto deludenti...

Pro:
- Tutte le versioni del gioco sono presenti e selezionabili dal menu principale, incluse special mission e l'edizione giapponese
- Doppiaggio italiano originale incluso, comprensivo di strafalcioni (""ipoderma"", ""Dottor Clark"", ""Guarda fuori Snake!""...) e accenti improbabili (è così brutto da fare il giro e diventare epico! Un doppiaggio entrato nella storia!)
- C'è un comodo menù interno dove potete vedere la copertina del gioco originale fronte e retro (E sapete tutti perchè guardare il retro della copertina è così importante, vero?!) o cambiare la porta del controller (anche qui devo davvero spiegarvi perchè? ""La vostra memoria è completamente vuota?"")
- Piccole chicche extra: è possibile aggiungere alla finta memory card interna una serie di falsi salvataggi di giochi Konami in modo che Mantis ve li legga :D
- è presente anche una apposita easter egg quando dovrete cambiare il cd per entrare nella fornace :D

Contro:
- è un porting in bassa risoluzione del gioco del 98... ficcare i cd originali dentro una ps3 rendeva il gioco più fluido e meno pixeloso di così!
Il frame rate è ballerino in diverse cutscene e ci sono dei caricamenti stranamente lenti tra un filmato e l'altro!
- Non è possibile ridurre il gioco in modalità finestra senza andare a cambiare manualmente i file di gioco nella cartella di installazione
- Le tracce audio sono vincolate ai sottotitoli, quindi non potrete cambiare lingua senza perdere anche la leggibilità...

Gioco promosso, ma solo perchè è MGS1: Konami poteva fare un porting molto più curato e aggiornato!

The whole entire game looks incredibly blurry and feels like it runs in slow motion. My PS1 copy that I play on the PS3 looks way better than this and not by a little bit but like a lot better. The resolution is unacceptable in 2023, playing this on a 1440p monitor was torture. I hope I can update my review to positive on the future but $20 is not worth it at all in this games current state.

Como bien dije en la reseña del 2 soy fan de la saga hace bastante tiempo. Éste juego es al que más cariño le tengo de los 3, quizás porque fue con el que me introduje en esta hermosa saga.

Básicamente esta ""Master Collection Version"" es una versión emulada de PS1 con logros. Aún así podrían haberse esforzado un poquito más y poner algún tipo de filtro para poder suavizar los gráficos. Pero bueno, vuelvo a mi frase de siempre ""KONAMI, PONELE VOLUNTAD LCDTM"" *léase con voz de Marito Borges*

Aunque siendo justo y para no darle con un caño a Konami banco el hecho de que compilen todas las versiones existentes de MGS tanto VR Missions como Integral en un solo ejecutable y que el usuario tenga la opción de elegir qué versión jugar (Se descargan como DLC). 

Para cerrar. Volver a este juego después de casi 10 años sin jugarlo y siendo lo más fiel posible a la versión de PlayStation fue un mimo al alma. A pesar de las puteadas que le digo a Konami porque sé que podrían hacer las cosas un poco mejor, en este caso fue suficiente. Hay cosas que pulir, sí eso no te lo voy a negar. Principalmente con el tema sonidos que por momentos se escuchan de pésima calidad, pero supongo que pueden ir corrigiendo esos fallos mediante actualizaciones. 

Calificación: 7 thunders sobre 10.

In concept this game is good, however the execution of its ideas are absolutely terrible. This game has no concept of the difference between challenging and frustrating, so all the moments in this game that have a difficulty increase are not harder because they are challenging, but because they are unfair. An example of this is when the game removes the mini-map from the player in order to make stealth harder. This does not make the game more challenging, but make it unfair as it is almost impossible to see enemies without the mini-map as for some reason the developers decided that an unmovable top down camera was the way to go, and that enemies should be able to spot you from outside the camera's range. The only way to see enemies without the map is to use first person mode, which makes you stand absolutely still. To add on to annoying mechanics there is weapon selection, some weapons when you select them pull you into their sights, which causes you to stand still, and you look in the direction you face. This is really painful as the game doesn't have enough control nor a long enough grace period to properly aim that weapon. Aim is also horrendous with normal weapons. The stinger is a lock on rocket launcher in the game, and it will just randomly loose a lock on. Boss battles are overly long, and have broken mechanics some times, such as stun locking you are having an impossible to dodge attack at a certain distance. There are parts in this game that are just plain mean, such as when you are tortured by Ocelot and if you die it's back to the menu screen to reload a save as opposed to just restarting the torture from there. I would give this game props for the story if it didn't break the 4th wall every other sentence. There are deprecated features in this game too. All in all this game is bad, and being old doesn't give it an excuse because Half life came out the same year as it, and Final Fantasy 7 came out a year before it.","","true","1700367534","1700367534","false","0","2","0.483288168907165527","false"

Yeah on my 1440p monitors or my 4k TV this game would look like shit, but playing metal gear 1, 2 and solid on my steam deck, the games looked pretty great. Between those games alone I got about 50 hours including the very awesome vr missions, definitely got my money's worth. So while the ports aren't the best they could be, I love the games for what they are and I'm glad I finally got to see what I have been missing out on for all these years. Metal gear solid did not dissapoint. It lives up to the hype, and I'm down to support this master collection to get me my volume 2 and keep the games coming. I want all of em on steam.","","false","1700161631","1700162042","true","0","9","0.633262693881988525","false"

Probably biggest one of them is crappy blurry visuals. I know it is an old game, but you can get it running at 4k with crystal clear graphics trough emulation on a potato! Dissapointing.

Second issue is sounds. I've played through original MGS more that a 1000 times and everything about this game is ingrained into my mind, I immediately spotted that some music tracks and SFX just don't sound right in this version. Probably misconfigured emulator that they bundle with this game.

Lastly controls. I have a muscle memory of the at this point, and man do they have latency in this one... Also the left thumb-stick is just mirroring a D-pad instead of having its own analogue input.

To anyone reading this review, if you were a fan of the original release, you'll enjoy it. Just make sure to save with Mei and don't ALT+F4 the game to close, or you may have issues with losing your save data. The only real issue I had was with the cinematics being slowed down and the audio being total POOP. But after removing the Japanese language pack it seemed to be much better.

Finalmente i primi 3 capitoli della saga di Metal Gear sono su steam e ci mi rende molto contento di poter rigiocare questa saga in comodità.
MA 
il porting in sè fa abbastanza pena: si tratta dei 3 giochi buttati con un emulatore, senza fare un minimo di lavoro su risoluzione e stabilità del gioco, MGS1 lagga negli stessi punti in cui laggava sulla console playstation (stesso discorso anche per gli altri) e la questione peggiora (questa cosa il realtà non ho ancora trovato altre testimonianze online ma non credo sia un problema dovuto solamente a me) se si volesse condividere lo schermo su discord o tramite un programma per trasmettere in live, facendo rallentare il gioco a 10fps e un audio comletamente rotto. 
MGS1 ha come gran comodità il fatto che se si tengono premuti i 2 pulsanti dorsali si apre una specie di menù dell'emulatore da cui è possibile modificare varie opzioni dello schermo (metterlo a schermo intero o in finestra ad esempio) o uscire dal gioco.
Ecco questo fantastico menu i successivi 2 capitoli non lo hanno rendendo anche la semplice uscita dal gioco un puzzle da risolvere. Per non parlare del fatto che senza questo menù non si può mettere il gioco da finestra a schermo intero e viceversa, e ogni tanto il software decide proprio di giocare con te continuando ad aprisi in finestra e rimanendoci..(OH se capità solo a me fatemelo notare perchè ci tengo)
Insomma, consiglio questo porting perchè avere i primi metal gear non era così facile da anni, sopratutto per chi lo volesse scoprire, ma allo stesso tempo per chi ha già i giochi in altre versioni mi sentirei di non consigliarne l'acquisto per ora, non ne vale la pena, attendete che konami, se lo farà, darà una sistemata. Dato che su Pc e su altre console sono esistite delle collection con giochi messi in condizioni migliori.
Punto a vantaggio è l'enorme masterbook che è dentro la collection, contenente tutti gli approfondimenti su trama, personaggi e curiosità all'interno del gioco. Insomma, una lista ben scritta e variegata, accomagnata dalle splendide illustrazioni di Shinkawa.","","false","1699876512","1699876512","true","0","3","0.544827580451965332","false"

However the collection isn't without its flaws, so of the more notable for MGS1 are;
* Sound crackles and skips (infrequently)
* Bilinear filtering (this filter is the worst invention ever)
* Original internal resolution.
* Lacks the original PSX Dithering effect (which I am a fan of)
* Lacks analogue controls, where the original had this feature (makes the Hind D fight a bit harder without 
   analogue)

It does give you;
* All the different versions of MGS1 (nothing quite as fun as playing in German)
* Fantastic Master Book to immerse yourself in the lore.
* Memory Card / Save Editor (For that great mind reading section of the game)
* Achievements (If you're into that)
* Updated on screen control prompts for the controller that you're using.

All in all, it is great, and will be even better when modders really do there thing to fix it up. There is already a patch and workaround for the horrendous bilinear filtering.

Many will say that playing the original with an emulator is better, and while that may be true, this is certainly not a bad way to play either.","","true","1699874188","1699874188","true","0","1","0","false"

If care about those and dont mind the issues noted above. Never tried emulating this so cant comment on that but it works with an Xbox style controller as well.

While I can imagine Twin Snakes would be a much more difficult port and source code to track down, I would have thought a cleaned up PC version would have made for one of the more sensible versions to be in this collection.

Either way, still enjoyed the trip down memory lane, would recommend to anyone just wanting this game on Steam and looking to go through the original game one more time.","","true","1699848877","1699848877","true","0","2","0.538461565971374512","false"

This collection on PC specifically? Bare minimum trash. Not even so little as resolution options, which even Square Enix's laziest efforts included. 

MGS 1 is completely limited to it's original PS1 resolution. Yes, it's the original charming pixely mess, but without the scanlines of a proper CRT it's rough to look at on a modern monitor. 

2 and 3, while perfectly ""playable"" at locked 720p resolutions, offer nothing beyond playing the games in their most primitive HD format. Objectively they're usable and could be argued as a satisfactory way to play these games conveniently, but beyond that it's a worthless effort. 

There are controller issues for some, bugs both original and newly introduced, and low quality audio. 

To be honest, I was surprised to see Konami bother doing this at all. But that's very small praise on such a shallow attempt. This is just slapping the Metal Gear IP across ours face while we suck at Konami's balls. 

The only reason I would bother with this is if you plan on using the MGSHDFix, at least until by some miracle resolution options are patched in.

And for MGS 1, look into ""alternatives"" online.","","true","1699834699","1699834783","false","1","15","0.631169795989990234","false"

I also have to add that I have not encountered any bugs and although the resolution is a bit annoying it adds to the nostalgia factor for me.

It sucks. 

This game has some of the most frustrating gameplay I've ever experienced. Other than the sniper rifle, there is no aiming mechanic for guns. You have to just face the enemy's general direction and hope that snake will auto-aim at them. This is made even more difficult by the fact that you can only see a tiny area around your character and a lot of times enemies are off-screen, still able to attack you and all you can do is blindly fire in the direction you hope they're in. This even happens for boss fights! And with the sniper rifle (the one boss you use it against), the aim moves extremely slowly and if the boss hits you, your aim gets whipped around to some random direction and you can't get it back to where you want to aim before getting hit again. Particularly maddening was part where you have to run up dozens of flights of stairs, constantly followed and being shot at by 2 guys. If you kill them, 2 more just instantly spawn. After a few floors, guys will start appearing ahead of you also, and you have to just let them hit you because there is no way to aim up the stairs.

Game world persistence is confusing. There is a lot of backtracking in the game, and sometimes enemies and items will respawn, other times they won't. One area has detection lasers that you have to get past twice, then on the 3rd time and further they just aren't there any more, with no game reason for it. You never get to actually deactivate the lasers, just get past them. Another area has land mines the first time you go through it, they're gone the 2nd time, and then back the 3rd time. Also, saving the game doesn't actually save the game how it was in when you saved. If you clear an entire room of enemies and then save, loading that save will just put you at the start of the room with all the enemies alive again.

Finally, snake just repeating what everyone says but in the form of a question is super annoying.","","false","1699657907","1699657907","false","5","2","0.433070838451385498","false"

Поэтому только сейчас первую часть одолел. 
 Игра хорошая, тут двух мнений быть не может. Правда, она очень плохо состарилась. Обращаю внимание, что дальнейшие примеры касаются исключительно версии из Master Collction Vol. 1. 
 Перво-наперво, что вызывает отторжение - техническое (скорее даже больше графическое) устаревание - картинка это просто вырвиглаз. Через пару часов игры натурально глаза болят. Вкупе с охуительными ракурсами местной камеры эффект прямо-таки чудовищный, что крайне негативно влияет на восприятие шикарной постановки. Сорян, когда два угловатых полена (на которых даже лица то с трудом различимы) на экране ведут философские беседы про жизнь и смерть, место человека в этом мире, любовь, верность долгу и подобным высоким материям, это воспринимаются крайне тяжело. Спасает исключительно озвучка. Атмосфера и погружение, на мой субъективный взгляд, максимально херится. Про разрешение 320x240 тактично умолчу. Один хуй это, по сути, эмулятор. Неужели нельзя было взять за основу самопальный вариант, в котором все уже доведено до ума?! 
 Второе, с чем не смог смирится до конца игры - это управление. Настолько дубового, неотзывчевого и стифового контроля персонажа редко где видел. Как будто не через геймпад управляю, а на рычагах трактора играю. Слышал мнение, что Кодзимба спецом сделал управление несколько неотзывчивым, но тут слух, не более. Сам проходил на геймпаде от Хуана. Возможно на плойковском было бы проще, хз. Ещё игра подъебывает тем, что по умолчанию идёт британская версия (она PAL если что), так что FPS на ней по умолчанию ниже 30 - 25 вроде, что само по себе тоже ухудшает экспириенс. 
  Поскольку первая часть МГС вещь новаторская, и можно сказать, что прародитель целого жанра, такого как стелс-экшен, то сам этот стелс выполнен несколько старомодно, что-ли. Например, противники не реагируют на звук ходьбы/бега Снейка. Но и зато нет такой дурнины, как отвлечение часовых/патрульных  брошенным предметом. Также очень хорошо реализованы спецгаджеты, вроде ПНВ и тепловизоров. Гранаты и в целом взрывчатка - ок. А со стрельбой, не так все однозначно - пистолет с ЛЦУ и FAMAS очень неприятно использовать из-за ОХУИТЕЛЬНОЙ камеры. Снайперка - это вообще трындец - в время боссфайта с Вульф орал как не в себя из-за дубового управления. Как будто гаубицу нацеливаю, а не винтовкой оперирую. Очень интересный ПТУР - вот прямо топового реализовано. Сейчас так и не делают даже. 
  Достаточно часто наблюдал похвалы этой части по боссфайтам - типа они самые топовые чуть ли не за всю историю видеоигр, но тут не соглашусь. Есть топовые файты - вроде Психомантиса (это вообще нечто, действительно, настолько кайфового босса ещё поискать надо), Вульф (с ней всё портит только дубовое управление), ну и наверное, Оцелот ещё прикольный. В бою с ним даже камера не бесит, наоборот, она там очень в тему. А есть духота вроде Рейвена (на холодном складу) и двух фаз с Рексом, и на мой взгляд, высососанная из пальца рукопашная битва с Ликвидом. Но, несмотря ни на что, схватки с боссами - это действительно фишка игры, тут абсолютно согласен.
 Сюжет - это детище Кодзимбы - гения, и этим всё сказано. Мне лично норм. Он хотя бы полный, без потерянных кусков вроде того, что было в Phantom Pain. Тема с кодеками - вещь. Очень работает на погружение.
 Резюмируя - МГС 1 - топ, Конами - клоп. Игра великая, она явно заслуживает более трепетного отношения к себе, нежели та похабень, что сваяла Конами с цель. поднять лавандоса. На мой взгляд, для вката в серию она тяжеловата. В нее нужно было играть в своё время, на первой плойке, после школки, но увы, не у всех такая возможность была. Если не хотите связыватся с эмуляторами, или не любите с ними заморачиваться,  наверное, можно попробовать. По скидке, ни в коем случае не за фулл прайс. Лично для меня первая МГС - самый необычный игровой опыт за последние лет пять (до этого была Персона 5, но она более нормисная, что ли...). Она вызывает эмоции, и к ней нельзя остаться равнодушным, а сейчас это дорого стоит. Так что - Je ne regrette rien","","false","1699395753","1699395753","true","0","5","0.566232919692993164","false"

科乐美最近再次开始了自己的本职工作：炒冷饭，而这次端上来的作品则是上面所提到的《合金装备》合集包，其中总共包括：
Metal Gear
Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake
Metal Gear Solid (Including VR Missions/Special Missions)
Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty (HD Collection version)
Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater (HD Collection version)
Metal Gear (NES/FC version)
Snake's Revenge
总计六部作品，很多玩家可能看见这些完全不一样的名字就开始疑惑，大部分的系列游戏不是应该仅仅副标题不同，怎么上面总共出现了Metal Gear和Metal Gear Solid两个完全不同的主标题，甚至后面还有一个FC版本以及Snake's Revenge这样直接没有了主体的作品？

这就要小岛秀夫和科乐美的故事开始将讲起，简单来说就是Metal Gear是完全由小岛秀夫主导制作的作品，而FC版本则是科乐美更改之后推出的美区特供版本，而蛇的复仇则是这个特供版本的续作，这两者的区别个人觉得最大的就是最终boss和一些解谜，特供版直接将boss换成了一个大电脑，而原版则是按照游戏的名字中复刻的机械单兵，同时这些谜题的缺失也让游戏少了一些小岛秀夫的味道，但是如果说FC版本很烂，那倒并不止于。

而小岛秀夫看到这个场面之后，直接炸裂，然后直接赶稿子，写制作出了Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake这款游戏，但是遗憾的是在MSX谢幕的浪潮之下，并没有激起太大的水花，这款无论是玩法还是画质相比之下都远优于前作的作品意外的销量惨淡。而事后小岛秀夫就开始了自己的复盘，在思索之中，小岛秀夫终于发现，这不是我的问题，这是时代的问题问题，什么垃圾主机，性能太差了，而随着小岛秀夫的反思和继续对于剧本玩法的打磨，那个称霸主机半壁江山的游戏机：PS索尼终于登场，在PS1发布的第四个年头终于发布。当然《合金装备》这个名字并不是官方的反应，科乐美给出的翻译是《潜龙谍影》，民间的翻译还有很多《金属齿轮》、《燃烧战车》、《特攻神谍》等等，主打一个百花齐放，如果玩家需要查询一些资料，用官方翻译来的快一些。

[h1]关于游戏的游玩体验[/h1]
说完历史，我们来说一下游戏的体验，因为这几款作品的年龄可能有些比笔者的年龄都大，众所周知，科乐美优势一个善于激发玩家们手动的能力的发行商，于是本作就出现了玩家想要游玩本作就需要安装补丁优化画面，更是需要一些模组来让Metal Gear Solid系列可以完美流畅的在steam上运行，感谢民间的模组大佬们持续一周的辛勤付出，也感谢科乐美给我这个机会体验到寻找补丁的快乐。

而这也是游戏为什么几款作品有着诸多差评的最大原因，合集中的Metal Gear竟然是唯一一个正面评价大于负面评价的作品，这大部分原因是因为其像素画面玩家对于1080p甚至的分辨率的需求大大降低，至于能不能全屏，这对于能体验到这款没有被科乐美特供删除的有着原本味道的作品来说已经无关重要了。


[h1]关于游戏的一些自己的看法[/h1]
为什么说小岛秀夫是天才，很大一部分是因为他屡次在无人问津的游戏类型中开创了历史的先河，而《Metal Gear》这款游戏就是如此，可能在现在的玩家看起来这部作品很多地方的想法都稍显稚嫩，在玩法上一个捉迷藏游戏居然是以俯视角来呈现，但是相比于各种爽快的射爆游戏，作为无人问津的潜入玩法，这个设计的提出已经是跨时代的行为，这款作品的潜入还停留在躲猫猫的部分，而在《Metal Gear Solid》之中，得益于ps主机性能的加持，即时演算得以实现，游戏3d的画面，更加多样的潜入玩法，不再局限于躲猫猫的潜入都让游戏的体验得到了质的飞跃，虽然画面在今天看来依旧稍显逊色，而之后数款作品中，潜行玩法的内容逐渐被丰富，以至于后面哪怕是半成品的幻痛依旧获得十分高的评价。

当然《合金装备》的成功也离不开小岛秀夫脑海中对于这个游戏中世界观的构造，这里就需要解释一下《Metal Gear》这个名字的由来。这个名字翻译过来其实最为直观的翻译是《金属齿轮》，其实这个翻译你未必能看懂而国产的另一个翻译:燃烧战车就直观了许多，游戏中玩家所有的目标最后都是一辆战车，这辆战车搭载着核弹头，同时可以以布加迪威龙的速度狂飙，直接就拥有着颇高的发射初速度，于是就对游戏世界的霸主产生了威胁，而游戏的故事围绕着此，展开，因为我中间几部剧情不是很熟悉，有需要的小伙伴建议去b站看视频，十分详细，还有参照事件。

[h1]购买指南[/h1]
[olist]
[*]你可以玩到《合金装备》的大部分版本
[*]可惜没有优化，需要手动打补丁

Metal Gear Solid is an absolute classic and also genre defining.
The story is far deeper than it first appears. It treats of important subjects with some touches of fiction.

Gameplay is top down, controller support has been extended but the og PS1 prompts were replaced with dualsense ones.

In terms of performance it's just like the og version. It's, like advertised not a remake. It's an upscaled version with customizable borders. Don't be a complete mor*n and expect 480fps, 32K, modern graphics.

However, i noticed minor visual bugs (a few textures under a tank for instance not being there).
Nothing major but it should be on the spot and evidently didn't get enough testing.

Story : 10/10
Graphics : 8/10
Gameplay : 10/10
Performance : 10/10

Total : 9.5/10

Small note to konami : Don't stain the series with horible new entries.
If Kojima is not in, it'll be a pass. Given the distater you made, your severe lack of respect towards your best dev... you lost all respect and should at least do the right thing and give him back Metal Gear and Metal Gear Solid franchises.

The only reason i got this is because i want to replay 1-3 on steam.
I'd also be down for 4 but that's pretty much it.

Given what happened to Kojima, i will not consider you for any potential award.","","true","1699306649","1699306649","true","1","1","0.503759443759918213","false"

This is the PS1 version running in an emulator and provides no display options or key binding functionality of any kind. It currently displays only at 240p, upscaled to 1080p with a bilinear filter that softens and somewhat blurs the image. There is also notable input lag and audio issues (popping and crackling) due to emulation issues. On PC, playing this on DuckStation is an infinitely better and more customizable experience. I will be interested if Konami will continue to update and fix some of these issues, we will have to wait and see.","","true","1699303630","1699303630","false","0","3","0.527649760246276855","false"

The story is probably the strongest part of the game as it is very much a believable and realistic story in terms of it's overall grounding in reality back in the 1990's.  The concept of a out of the way nuclear testing site set in a remote area which also serves as grounds for a top secret weapons reaserach  and development makes perfect sense. The characters are also quite memorable and while the story does stray into the unreal territory at times it is the simple fact of how much grounded the overall story is that helps make it memorable and probably one of the best stories told in gaming. 

At it's core the gameplay is still very much like how it was back in the playstation 1 era. So if you remember any tricks from back then they will serve you well here as they can still be used here. 

So for a collection how does it hold up? The answer is sub par to ok at best. This is by far an inferior version at least in terms of the technical aspect of it with lots of jagged edges and such. You really get the feeling like they just flat out did a few simple modifications to the code along with a few necessary changes and copy and pasted the original PS1 files whole sale. So not the best port by any stretch of the imagination. Granted this version included in the collection does include both MGS1 and MGS VR missions which is just a series of challenges released as a standalone disk back in the day but is included here. Again all the same tricks from MGS1 apply there as well. 

So is it worth it? As part of a collection yes. Standalone? Maybe. At this time this is the only version currently available on Steam which means if Steam is your go to for gaming on PC then this is what your option is to play this classic. That being said there are other ports available on other platforms so it depends on if you just want to stick with Steam or check out other version available. As for me well I'm giving it a thumbs up but this is a place where a middle of the road option would be helpful here as it's not great but it's not bad either as an overall package.","","true","1699245969","1699245969","true","0","0","0","false"

Also maybe this will change in the future, but as of the time of writing this (Nov-5-2023), if the game CRASHES at any point or if you Alt-f4 to try and exit quickly, even if you saved in-game, it won't actually lock in your save and end up not saving at all.

Streaming from PC to Steam Link hard-wired on a big TV, and using a DualSense controller. Everything always played well and was enjoyable. I have also played a bit on Steam Deck, also works great there too, and the cloud saves transfer easily.

Have been a big Metal Gear series fan for a long time, since around the release of MGS1. I have played MGS1 every possible way, including the original, re-releases, Twin Snakes, and emulated versions. I don't care what you have to say that these already exist in other forms. With this new Master Collection, and a more official way to play on Steam, with cloud saves keeping my saves for the future, and some achievements to earn, plus add-on bonus content like the Master Book and Screenplay, and ability to transfer between devices, this collection is worth it to me.

This MGS1 Master Collection version has been so much fun. In one digital place, with ease of use, I now have the North American version, the PAL versions, and the Japanese version. You can install the language packs and they literally enable alternate game versions so you can experience what they were like. They have also included the North American VR Missions, the European Special Missions, and the Japan Integral version with all of its content it seems like.

They all have ability to manage the ""PS1"" game saves before entering each game. This is especially helpful if you want to fake some game saves for other games for the true experience (I won't spoil why), but it's a nice added touch. All the versions also maintain their own saves separately, and the cloud saves help ensure you can use them across devices easily. All of this alone makes this so nice to have and worth owning.

There's also an L1+R1 menu overlaid on top when you are in-game that offers and handles a few unique things like swapping controllers, or exiting back to the main menu.

The Master Book and Screenplay included are incredible. I do wish the image quality on the Master Book was a little better when zooming in, but as a fan of the series, it's an awesome addition to just soak myself in the lore and enjoy what this series is all about. I would buy it physical if they sold them that way. The Screenplay is also fun as an alternate way to experience the game and story, and even for most hardcore fans, it's likely to reveal some hidden moments maybe you didn't know about.

The games are presented mostly in their original format, which I understand seems dated to many, but I personally had no issue. I played on a giant TV for the most part and I enjoyed myself through numerous playthroughs, and will continue to play more. I don't mind these are aged and not the best looking. I don't mind that it's got some old control styles. That's part of the charm of these older games. Just be cautious at the end and don't hit the wrong button when asked to save your completed file. I will note the ""Special Missions"" plays a tad odd in terms of frame rate. I think this is due to PAL stuff back then and the fact it wasn't fundamentally the same refresh rate originally.

I will also note that the Steam controller options overlaid on top make this so much more enjoyable and fun. You can make a button hold feature to skip past codec's on subsequent plays if you want. You can set turbo settings to cheat parts of the game. You can do some cool things you otherwise mighty not have been able to do. Having them officially on Steam, having Steam save my games for the future (managing emulation saves can be a pain, so Steam adds value here), being able to seamlessly transfer from PC to Steam Link to Steam Deck adds value.

I will enjoy playing this way for a long time to come.","","true","1699188941","1699189041","true","0","1","0.516908168792724609","false"

We can remove the smoothing and set full screen. That's a huge step forward. Now i hope they allow us to tweak the emulator a bit more. 

Like increasing the internal resolution and allow us to change keyboard and controller mapping.
So like my review from MG1/MG2:SS i've changed from negative to positive.

However still have some work to do.

Here's a list for Konami to see.

- Analog input not working correctly.
- Cutscene skipping without any button pressing
- Delay after skipping cutscene (PS1 version issue)
- Add graphical options such as (refresh rate , resolutions and V-sync)

Nice patch so far, Continue Konami fix those masterpieces. You deserve the praise.

I think over all this game is fantastic and I'm loving it so far.

First time I played a Metal Gear Solid game outside of The Phantom Pain was Twin Snakes, the graphically-updated version of this game, on a barebones emulator, and holy mother of God, was I blown away. So much nostalgia for a game I had never experienced, and I felt so bad for missing out as a kid, considering just how many others hold this gem as a gleaming childhood memory. While the classic Metal Gear Solid looks graphically outdated (and then some; the character models don't even have eyes) the gameplay holds up spectacularly, and it's fun as hell; sneaking around a giant base, key-spamming to choke out guards as they yell ""OOH-OOH-OOH-OOH-OOH-OOH-OOH"" before neck-snapping them, then sprinting to cover over clinking metal tiles while hearing ""HUH? WHAT WAS THAT NOISE?"" over and over again evokes a curious longing for ""times gone by"" that I don't really know how to describe. The humorous tone of the game grabbed me very early on; the dialogue between Snake and his team, deadly-serious one moment before becoming silly in the next, made me laugh loud and often; Snake's interactions with [spoiler]Otacon[/spoiler] straight [i]killed[/i] me sometimes. Across from this, the story was gripping throughout; I liked the bevy of boss fights the game throws at the player, it really helps them keep engaged. Metal Gear Solid's anti-war themes developed fairly early-on, becoming much clearer in the sequels, but it's a breath of fresh air to hear such ruminations without the severe cases of heavy-handedness that modern games' messages fall into.

The [spoiler]Revolver Ocelot (best villain, I'm infatuated with his constant gunspinning), Psycho Mantis (there's a good reason why it's so iconic, what with the controller switching and all), and Hind-D[/spoiler] fights were particularly fantastic, and of course, the replaying of ""Encounter"" and ""Duel"" never got grating or repetitive for me even once. The story's reveals that rendered Solid Snake's journey ever more intricate and confusing as the game went on made fighting [spoiler]Metal Gear Rex and Liquid Snake[/spoiler] at the end a couple of healthy payoffs, not to mention the re-involvement and lore-dive into [spoiler]Gray Fox[/spoiler] from MG2:SS. Metal Gear Solid truly was a product of a different era of games, one with no understanding of poor live-service, constant updates and bugfixes, and incessant microtransactions, but a full understanding of over-the-top passion-driven stories, memorable heroes and villains, crazy twists, and clever gameplay mechanics that could keep a player, old or young, entertained for dozens of hours and multiple playthroughs with room for more.

Metal Gear Solid is a must-have for old-school and retro-minded players alike, and I'm glad I decided to give it a try when I did. While 3 is my all-time favorite of the games I've played so far, for me, 1 ties with 2 as a close pair of seconds. Hideo Kojima is 100% worthy of the praise he has received over the course of Metal Gear Solid's lifetime, and what Konami did to him after TPP remains an absolute travesty. Kinda makes me regret buying the games from them, to be honest...regardless of whether you play MGS on Steam, GOG.com, or an emulator...just play MGS. It's worth every second.","","true","1699144015","1699144670","true","0","0","0.477941185235977173","false"

The outward presentation and included content is stellar. The main menu is well crafted and matches the aesthetic of the series, and the inclusion of all 8 versions of the main game (plus all 3 versions of VR Missions) in addition to the bonus content is a great value, but I cannot recommend this as the definitive Metal Gear Solid experience.

The emulator is plagued with serious issues that the user cannot adjust.
- The game only outputs a bilinear-filtered image, with no options for sharp/raw pixels or a CRT filter effect.
- Very noticeable input lag.
- DualShock input is misconfigured. MGS1 supports analog control but for some reason the left stick is mapped onto the D-Pad, locking Snake to 8-directional movement. Rumble is still enabled, however, so it's not just emulating an original, digital gamepad.
- Streamed audio in cutscenes frequently pops and it seems to get worse the longer the game runs. This is especially bad during FMV cutscenes, where the sound constantly stutters.
- Less than ideal sound emulation. Reverb effects and music playback is subtly off from what the game sounded like on a real PlayStation or more accurate emulators like mednafen & DuckStation.

All of these issues could have been circumvented if Konami had made it easy to extract the CD images and play them in a better emulator. Unfortunately they've ""washed"" the BINs by overwriting the original PSX EXEs with zeroes, rendering them unplayable. (Users could theoretically patch the code back in, but it wouldn't be worth the effort as working ROMs can be found online in abundance.)

Additionally, I've noticed several mistakes made in the presentation of the Screenplay Book's English translation. Scene headings are inexplicably missing and there are various formatting errors. For instance, words in italics were rendered in the wrong place, sometimes underneath other parts of the text, sometimes on the wrong page...
(2023/11/14 EDIT: The issues with the Scenario Book have been quietly fixed in the latest update.)

Still a better way to experience MGS than the buggy, broken PC port from 2000, though.","","true","1699137914","1699992833","false","2","114","0.857253432273864746","false"

PS 1 döneminde oynadığım ve o zamanlar bitiremediğim ama ağzımın açık kalmasına sebep olan oyundur Metal Gear Solid. Bu incelemeyi oyunu zaten oynamışlar için değil de seriye ilk defa girişecekler veya diğer oyunlarını oynayıp Metal Gear'ın ilk Solid oyununu oynamayı düşünenler için yazacağım. İncelemeye başlamadan önce pc portu hakkında biraz konuşmak istiyorum. Oyun daha çok port değil de ps emülatörü gibi hissettiriyor. Oyunda herhangi bir grafik geliştirmesi bulunmuyor. Direkt playstation versiyonunu oynuyorsunuz. En azından geniş ekran desteği olsaymış iyi olurmuş. Bu yönden sizi hayal kırıklığına uğratması muhtemel. Oyunu daha önceden bitirdiyseniz tekrar oynamak için bir nedeniniz yok. Bunların haricinde oyunu sorunsuz oynayıp bitirebiliyorsunuz.

Hikaye
Metal Gear oyunlarının hikayesi her ne kadar gerçek olaylarla bağlaşsa da aslında alternatif tarihi ele alıyor. Fakat bu alternatif tarih günümüz dünyasından çokta ayrışmıyor ve sanki böyle olaylar olmuşta halka açıklanmamış gibi yansıtılıyor. Oyun Metal Gear 2'nin 6 yıl sonrasında geçiyor. Zanzibar olayından sonra Solid Snake kayıplara karışmış fakat Shadow Moses'de olan olaylar kendisinin sahaya tekrar dönmesini sağlıyor. Amerikan Hükümeti Shadow Moses adasında olan olayları duyduktan sonra büyük bir politik krizin eşiğine geliyor ve krizi engellemek için Roy Campbell ve ekibini görevlendiriyor. Adaya birisi sızmalı ve içerdeki durumu kontrol altına almalı fakat bu iş tabii ki bu kadar kolay olmuyor. Roy Campbell eski dostu Solid Snake'yi arayıp bir kez daha yardımını istiyor. Biz de tam olarak burda Snake'nin kontrolünü ele alıyoruz ve durumu araştırmaya başlıyoruz. Metal gear oyunlarının en önemli özelliklerinden birisi hikaye'yi hem ara sahnelerle hem de codec üzerinden iki farklı yoldan anlatması. En sevdiğim özelliklerden birisi olan codec üzerinden saha dışındaki ekip arkadaşlarınzla konuşup muhabbet edebiliyor, yardım isteyebiliyor ve az da olsa goygoy yapabiliyorsunuz. Shadow moses adasında işler karışık ama durum bu kadarıyla kalmıyor. Olası bir politik kriz yüzünden Snake ve ekibi hızlı hareket etmeli ve zor kararlar almalılar. Saha dışındaki politik mücadele de bizi zorluyor ve krizi bizzat snake ile yaşıyorsunuz. Oyun hiçbir zaman tempoyu düşürmüyor aksine ilerledikçe daha da artıyor. Size şu kadarını söyleyebilirim oyundan sıkılmanız çok zor ve sürekli kendisine bağlıyor sizi.

Grafikler
Grafikler hakkında pek söylenecek bir şey yok aslında. 1998 yapımı bir oyundan nasıl bir grafik bekliyorsanız aynen öyle. Daha önce de bahsettiğim gibi hiçbir grafiksel geliştirme yok. Yine de belki ilk oynayışım olmadığı için de olabilir fakat grafikler oynanmayacak bir derecede değil. Oyuna ilk girdiğinizde gözünüze batsa da oynadıkça alışıyorsunuz ve hikaye'ye kendinizi kaptırıyorsunuz.

Oynanış
Metal Gear Solid'i devrimsel yapan şey aslında oynanışta saklı. Tabii bunun üzerine hikayeyi eklerseniz bir başyapıt oluyor. Daha önce de belirttiğim gibi oyunda Shadow Moses'a sızmış bir ajansınız. Oyun size ajan olduğunuzu her zaman hissettiriyor. Bu yüzden Metal Gear Solid bir Call of Duty oyunu değil. Yakalanırsanız düşmanlar alarma geçiyor ve takviye kuvvet çağırıyorlar. Merminiz kısıtlı zaten ve çatışmaya girmek pek akıllıca değil bu yüzden. Oyun size gizlilik için her türlü imkanı sunuyor ve bazı sahneler ve boss fightlar dışında kimseyi öldürmeden oyunu bitirebiliyorsunuz. İsterseniz havalandırma boşluklarından ilerleyebilirsiniz, emp bombalarıyla kameraları kısa bir süreliğine devre dışı bırakabilirsiniz, hatta mgs'nin meşhur özelliği kolilere saklanıp düşmanların arasından sıvışabilirsiniz. Oyunda nasıl ilerlemek istiyorsanız ona göre bir seçenek var ve hepsi işe yarıyor. Ekipman kullanımı oyunun büyük bir bölümünü oluşturuyor ve görevi tamamlamak için bunları kullanmanız şart. Termal gözlüğü ve mayın dedektörünü sık sık kullanmanızı tavsiye ederim. Eğer lazerleri görmek isterseniz sigaranızı kullanıp dumanıyla açığa çıkarabilirsiniz. Oyunda bahsi geçmeyen bir özellik ise fast travel. Oyunda fast travel yapabiliyorsunuz bunun için gitmek istediğiniz yerin kolisinin içine girip kamyonetin kasasında biraz beklemeniz. Bir süre sonra düşmanlar istediğiniz yere götürecek sizi. Bunun gibi detaylar oyunun seviyesini çok yukarı çekiyor. Ayrıca eğer boss fightla ilgili yardım isterseniz codec üzerinden Nastasha'yı arayarak yardım isteyebilirsiniz. Oynanışla ilgili tek şikayetim oyunun yaşını gerçekten hissettirmesi. Çatışmada nişan almanız zor ve canınızı çok sıkabiliyor. Bazı silahları first person bakış açısıyla kullanmanız gerekiyor ki hassasiyet pek de iyi değil oyunda. Bahsetmek istediğim bir diğer özellik istediğiniz zaman first person bakış açısına geçebiliyorsunuz ama o kadar. Bu bakış açısını sadece etrafa bakmak için kullanabiliyorsunuz. Eğer bir nesneyi göremiyorsanız bu sayede daha rahat görebiliyorsunuz bu yüzden sık sık kullanmanızı tavsiye ederim.

Müzikler ve seslendirmeler
Oyunun bir diğer güçlü tarafıysa müzikleri ve seslendirmeleri. David Hayter(Solid Snake) ve Paul Eiding( Roy Campbell) başta olmak üzere seslendirmeler gerçekten harika. Zaten kendileri serinin hayranları ve işlerini ne kadar severek yaptıklarını görebiliyorsunuz. Müzikler ise bir o kadar güzel. The best is yet to come özellikle sizi alıp uzaklara götürüyor. Eğer oyunlarda bunlara önem veriyorsanız sizi kesinlikle üzmeyecektir Metal Gear Solid.

Sonuç olarak eğer daha önce oynamadıysanız veya uzun zaman önce oynayıp bitirdiyseniz size kesinlikle tavsiye ederim. Oynanış ve grafikler eski gelebilir ama biraz zaman geçirdikten sonra alışıyorsunuz ve oyuna dalıyorsunuz. Eğer yeni bir şey arıyorsanız üzüleceğinizi söylemeliyim. Okuduğunuz için teşekkür eder ve keyifli oyunlar dilerim.

[h1]-------------------------------------[/h1]
[h1][b]Au niveau du portage[/b][/h1]
On est face à de l'[b]émulation PS1 ultra-basique[/b]. Konami ont dû commencer le développement en même temps que l'annonce. Ça fait vraiment pâle figure quand on compare aux travaux de Nightdive, ce jeu mérite mieux.

[h1]Les plus[/h1]
• Le choix des versions : on peut choisir entre toutes les versions du jeu existantes dont les versions européennes doublées
• Des bonus sympas dans le launcher

[h1]Les moins[/h1]
• [u]Aucune option[/u], que ce soit un choix de filtre, la résolution, le mode fenêtré sans bordure…
• 4:3 uniquement (compréhensible pour la mise en scène des cinématiques mais on aurait au moins pu avoir du 16:9 pour les phases de jeu)
• [u]50 Hz[/u] pour les versions européennes
• Quand on choisit [u]une langue c'est voix + texte[/u], impossible de choisir séparément. Le jeu émule les fichiers ISO tel quel.
• [u]Les déplacements ne prennent pas en compte l'analogique[/u] alors que l'original était compatible Dual Analog. Très pénible quand on vise.
• Un bug que j'ai eu : j'avais des micro ralentissements (qui affectent le visuel ET le son vu que c'est de l'émulation) qui ont disparu quand j'ai passé le jeu en fenêtré sans bordure avec un outil externe.
• Un autre bug : vers la fin de la conversation Codec avant le boss de fin les voix étaient dédoublées, générant un écho désagréable (VF)
[h1]-------------------------------------[/h1]
[h1][b]Le jeu en lui-même[/b][/h1]
[i]Metal Gear Solid[/i] est le 3ème épisode de la série et réinterprète énormément d'idées de [i]Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake[/i] en les adaptant en 3D. Un jeu culte à faire absolument.

[h1]Les plus[/h1]
• Mise en scène incroyable pour l'époque avec un bon scénario
• Une VF excellente (1er degré, je ne comprendrai jamais ceux qui la critiquent)
• Une tonne de dialogues optionnels par codec tous doublés
• Un gameplay très complet avec plein d'armes et d'objets
• Une OST superbe
• Plein de petits détails

[h1]Les moins[/h1]
• Certains objets sont quasiment inutiles
• Des allers-retours redondants sur la fin","","false","1699130598","1699130598","false","0","5","0.60000002384185791","false"

I feel grateful to live in a world where such gloriously unhinged and wholesome creativity and craftsmanship as the first four Metal Gear Solid games can exist. Just an all around masterpiece of a saga. Like what the 6 Star Wars films are to movies or Lord of the Rings is to fantasy novels, MGS is in a league of its own as a groundbreaking, kickass and heartfelt work of art in the medium of interactive entertainment and the first game is still the most compelling. No other game tests your moral fiber the way the torture segment does or titillates the way the story of Snake transcending his genetic fate and awakening does. 

The cerebral and emotional story, the endearing characters, the god tier music, the awesome Yoji Shinkawa character/mechanical designs and depth of meaning are some of the best in any form of story telling to me. It could stand on its own as a show or book but the tactical and stimulating cinematic stealth action and interactive element it was built around really adds to the impact. 

With moments like the torture ultimatum, the stinger missile stalemate and the microwave room, these games truly harness the unique possibilities of of interactive dramatic storytelling in a way I've never seen elsewhere and move me in a way few things have. 

Along with the epic mythological sci-fi secret agent-soldier melodrama, the games always come with a good amount of real world knowledge and concepts incorporated into the the story, codecs and gameplay; providing a lot of food for thought on subjects ranging from the indomitable human spirit overcoming the dehumanizing effects of war through love and integrity, the sociopolitical implications of AI and genetic experimentation, the horrors of the military industrial complex and nukes, all the way to obscure facts on the flora and fauna of the Alaskan wilderness, Russian jungles and the history of cardboard boxes. I love that these games are willing to have characters spiel in mini documentary-esque monologues amidst the action.

There's nothing quite like Metal Gear and anyone who enjoys a well designed single player narrative or unique unfiltered art owes it to themselves to check these classics out.
 
At last accessible on pc and modern consoles. It could have easily been more upscaled and refined but at least they didn't mess with it or censor it and they seem to be releasing regular updates to address the shortcomings. It's a nice bonus being able to pause the cutscenes with the new menu as well.","","true","1699117960","1718645865","true","0","1","0.52173912525177002","false"

1). Don't skip codec calls and cut-scenes or you'll get confused 
2). Nano-machines = Magic, just accept it to bypass additional potential confusion in trying to understand it
3). Embrace the confusion, you're going to be confused, Snake is even confused for a portion of the game so why not you too

In essence, Metal Gear Solid 1 is a complicated family drama that is set in a secret military base where everyone has trauma and trauma dumps on Snake throughout the game. Although being set in a fictional world, MGS1 pulls on the real fragility of nuclear weapons while simultaneously exposing fragile complex emotions shared by a majority of it's characters on varying sides of the same conflict. 

The main theme is GENE(s) and although it's name dropped at least a dozen times, the game itself laid the foundation for stealth and drama heavy genres of video games while simultaneously raising the bar for the artistic medium of video games. 

Also, Meryl's codec frequency is on the back of the CD case so good luck with that on the digital master collection.","","true","1699070688","1699154063","true","1","1","0.502074718475341797","false"

КАК ТАМ САМА ИГРА?
Вам придется принять, что это игра пс1. Да, инвертированные ""ПРИНЯТЬ"" и ""ОТМЕНИТЬ"". Все как-то неудобно и отталкивающее. Но можно свыкнуть. Зато есть много разных деталей. А вы вот знали, что есть альтернативный способ прохождения психомантис с уничтожением статуй? Диалоги появляющиеся из-за ваших действий. И это интересно узнавать. Но и игра хорошо воспринимается как фильм.  Да, долгие диалоги по кодеку и катсцены, но стоит лучше расслабиться и вникнуть во все это. И ОДИН МИКРО СОВЕТ! вр мисии которые идут отдельно.. много воспоминаний о них неприятных... Но хочу выделить несколько. Мистика (или как там его) и про киборга ниндзю. В первой мы получаем мелкий и прикольный детектив, в котором мы будем расследовать убийство одного охранника. Нам дают текст, который может являться хорошей подсказкой, труп, возле которого предмет подсказка и 3 подозреваемых, один из которых УБИВЦА! Иногда все банально просто, но в некоторых вы уже сдадитесь и на удачу будите хватать за жепу. А миссии за Грей Фокса.. ну... Вы играете за Грей Фокса со своим хорошим геймплеем. Но есть нюанс.. 3 СУКА МИССИИ ДЛЯ ПРОРАБОТАНОЙ И ИНТЕРЕСНОЙ МЕХАНИКИ! 

САМ ПОРТ
Ну... кал. 4:3 игра с мелкими проблемами. И все. Ничем не отличается от прошлых версий. 
Спасибо челу из сообщества и моду на норм графен в мгс1! Благодаря нему можно в настройках бахнуть 16:9 и кайфовать.

As Solid Snake, a legendary soldier, players embark on a mission filled with political intrigue, shadowy organizations, and moral dilemmas. One of the standout aspects of Metal Gear Solid is its masterful blend of cinematic presentation and interactive gameplay. The game seamlessly transitions between intense, action-packed gameplay segments and meticulously crafted cutscenes, reminiscent of a Hollywood blockbuster.

Metal Gear Solid's characters are as iconic as the game itself. Solid Snake, the enigmatic and battle-hardened protagonist, showcases a depth of character rarely seen in video games at the time. The supporting cast, including the eccentric Otacon, the ruthless Revolver Ocelot, and the enigmatic Sniper Wolf, are equally compelling and add layers of complexity to the narrative.

　正直PS1のゲームなので今でも楽しめるのか心配でしたが、まったくもって心配不要でした。
　「20世紀最高のシナリオ」と称される濃厚なストーリーとキャラクター同士の関係、ステルスアクションゲームとしての作り込まれた要素、PS1でここまでできるのかと驚かされるカットシーンのキャラクターの細かい動き、とにかく楽しめました。
　声優さんの演技も非常に良く、久しぶりに夢中になってしまいました。
　さらに、マスターコレクション版になったことで、仮想セーブデータを登録できるようになり、某ボス戦で使えるセーブデータを使ったネタを気軽に楽しめるようになりました。MGS、MGSインテグラルに加え、海外でしか発売されていないバージョンのメタルギア・ソリッドも遊べ、まさにマスターコレクションというにふさわしい出来！！！
と言いたいところですが、他のレビューにもある通り、初期の頃にあった倍速になる不具合など、様々な不具合があり、ベタ移植に追加でテコ入れしたような出来になっています。あと、ゲームキューブのTWIN SNAKEという作品が収録されていなかったのは少し残念でした。
　マスターコレクションという出来かと言われる怪しいですが、ゲーム自体は非常に面白く、また、おまけに初代メタルギア、メタルギア2もついてきて2750円とそこそこ安いのでおすすめです。

It's all locked at 30 FPS, which is in itself a deal-breaker for me. I really don't think it would've required a lot of effort to include such basic and commonplace settings.  

I think the fundamental issue here is that Konami is delusional. They actually think that these archaic and dated games hold up so well today that no adjustments are needed to make them bearable in 2023. But that's just not the case.

Second play-through i reload my tanker save cuz my other save didnt save again.... i beat ocelot and listen to bakers dialog, and sure enough it froze again...at the same point...i am pissed at this point cuz i had to start from my tanker save again which is not far but still annoying.

so i decided to skip the dialog blow right past it, going to save otacon learned my lesson so i have multiple saves thru out the game name, get to the ninja and find out it froze during otacon's dialog too....OMG!!!! tried again this time going to skip thru the dialog, NOPE the game says F U not going to let u do that again, so now i cant get past this dialog and i am so disappointed with it for a bug this big and this obvious it should have been fixed before release.... not patched afterwards...my opinion anyway for now i will give it a 1 out of 5 stars and a 1 is being nice cuz i still love this game i love all the metal gear games i just hope they fix it soon so i can finish....","","true","1698981615","1698981615","false","0","2","0","false"

It's crazy to think it has been 25 yrs since the first time I have played this game. I have grown use to playing the NTSC version. I could never get use to the higher frame rate compared to the PAL version. This release has both and while most people will no doubt go for the higher frames. I personally played the PAL version. 

There's lots of complaints about the games controls being sluggish, lots of input lag and a smeared look to the graphics. I've got to say, I don't think there is a problem. This game is exactly how I remember the PAL version. Not only that, but it's the most hassle free play through I've had of this game in a long time. The original frame rate was a lot more comfortable and felt just how it should. 

Okay, the graphics look dated. That Playstation look was quite impressive at the time. But anyone under 30 yrs old is going to find it seriously ugly. It could be improved upon if Konami implemented all this emulation options, However, it would take away the charm of the original Playstation era. I want to the see the weird jittery textures, the haziness and blockiness (Younger people will not).

Old timey graphics aside, there's plenty to enjoy. The story is still really fun. Plenty of great characters supported by a great script and excellent voice acting. The music is also fantastic. One of my favourite game soundtracks. The controls are different by today's standards but they're simple, effective and feel like a step up from the previous game (Metal Gear 2). 

I'll be honest. I have no real complaints. I really don't. I enjoyed the heck out of this game. It may be partly nostalgia but I also went into it with realistic expectations, unlike some. No, there isn't 4k graphics, HDR, jiggle physics and all the stuff youngins demand on their TikToks in 2023. If you are expecting that, just forget about it. If you just want a great game to play and have your expectations (and sense of entitlement) are in check, this is a buy.","","false","1698893277","1698893277","true","1","2","0.489496976137161255","false"

The game and its story, and all its theater and cinema, is enjoyable and great fun to play and watch, I feel. My [b]recommendation[/b] is for one who enjoys a game with a stronger cinematic storytelling experience, and is aware of the stronger and sensitive themes present within.

[hr][/hr]
[h1]negative feedback and concerns[/h1]
[h2]input responsiveness[/h2]
At the time of release, the game felt laggy to parse the controller inputs. You move your character forward, and it feels like the character does not move instantly, as I believe it to have done upon the original 1990s game. By the time I had completed my playthrough a week later, I no longer perceived this. Still, if such an issue exists, it's something I consider to be a strongly negative consequence to owning this release. [b]I suggest not purchasing pending this issue's confirmed resolution by reputable community members.[/b]

[h2]save game state manager interface[/h2]
I experienced a problem where there was no confirmation given when exiting from the Saved Game state manager interface the Master Collection provides for managing a set of eight virtual PlayStation memory cards. I had beaten the game, and attempted to copy my New Game save to a new virtual memory card. I backed out and lost those saves after I had deleted the originals, believing my job to be done. This is a problem. It needs a confirmation and more clear understanding of the interface.

[h2]SPECULATION: visual graphics rendering[/h2]
There may be occasional see-through textures or failed rendering. I cannot say, but I saw this proposed, and it's not my memory that this occurs, and so I provide this as speculative negative feedback.

[h2]occasional audio pop[/h2]
There is, at least upon my hardware, audio choppiness present at a few times throughout the game. It kind of pops like someone vocalizing ""[i]pop[/i]"" into a microphone. This is not present in the original 1990s game experience.

[h2]retroactively altered in-game texts and interfaces[/h2]
The changed text to represent modern controllers within the game's original on-screen texts is a little disturbing, actually. It feels strange not seeing the SONY PlayStation's square, triangle, circle, X or ""[i]START[/i]"" and ""[i]SELECT[/i]"" being written in these interfaces.

[h2]critical referencing of external materials[/h2]
The game requires a player to refer to the original physical game media's case, and more specifically the paper sleeve/jacket within that case. High resolution scans of this material is provided for players in the Master Collection interface... but it is my concern that being or becoming aware of this implementation, and further the means to access it, is not obvious.

[hr][/hr]
[h1]positive feedback[/h1]
[h2]disc swap sequence animation[/h2]
I appreciate the disc swap animation present when going from disc 1 to disc 2 and vice versa. Notably, this process occurs automatically and receives no user input, which I feel to be favorable.

[h2]game controller port change setting[/h2]
I appreciate the implementation of the game controller port change setting as a simple toggleable binary menu option. This is how I imagined it being implemented and so, in my understanding, it is the best implementation.

[h2]referenced KONAMI game save data[/h2]
The way of adding whichever KONAMI game save data you want, for use with a particular moment in the game where these saves can be referred to, is great, I feel. I added just the one that was the game I owned when I played in my childhood, and that thoroughly satisfied me.

[hr][/hr]
[h1]about the reviewer[/h1]
I'm a 1992 millennial, and so I'm part of the audience where this game was of contemporary social and technological relevance as a child growing up. It is an experience I enjoy and appreciate, and I feel has good impact for me.

I note that I will describe myself today as a casual player of the game — one who feels enthusiastic, appreciative, happy and fun about [i]METAL GEAR[/i] and its storytelling and characters — but not one who'd consider themself knowledgeable about the game's workings, professed in its mechanical technique or any sort of eccentricities or deep knowledge and talent that may arise with more enthusiastic fans than myself. My brief review is a reflection of this experience and mentality I describe here.

My playthrough prior to this review was a just under 13 hour HARD mode clear. I'd never beaten HARD before as a child, nor had I attempted. I was unable to persist through the [spoiler]torture sequence[/spoiler], however, and further I found the [spoiler]METAL GEAR REX[/spoiler] sequence to be the most difficult — I suggest more difficult than I'd like.","","true","1698886438","1698886543","true","0","6","0.537824809551239014","false"

※初代MGSが目的なら買ってはいけません
1.4になったので起動してみましたが、最初のデモ(タイトルの前)で強制終了、再起動後はタイトルメニューがカクカクでまともに動かない。これが今のKONAMIですね。監督を追い出すからこんな杜撰な仕事しかできなくなる。大人しくスポーツクラブ運営に専念してください。
PS2実機と1-3を購入しても実機のほうがお得です。快適にクリア可能なので。PS2はPS1タイトルがプレイ可能です。
※PS2本体型番75000以降はPS2しか動かないことがあります。買うなら70000までです。


初期Ver.のレビュー
未購入者は大型アップデートまで待ってください。体感はβ版です。本当に未完成の手抜き移植。
解像度はオリジナルをアップコンバートしただけなので、表示がおかしくなります。つまりFHDは大嘘です。
褒めている人は「プレイできて幸せ」と言って思考停止しているだけの工作員とKONAMI信者なので、信用してはいけません。
この出来なら圧倒的不評になってもおかしくないのに。
監督への侮辱でしかない。

何度もクラッシュするせいで先に進めない。諸々の問題から、ド素人がスクリプトを担当したようにしか思えない。
かといって返金したら他のプレイ可能タイトルまで返金になるからできない。

PS1の解析なんてプログラマ科の学生でもできる簡単な構造なのに、この程度のシステムの移植すらできない。

Asinine cultural and gender portrayals aside, MGS has aged shockingly well due to its intense and unpredictable gameplay, its pacing, and its story (which is refreshingly simple compared to the more bonkers later installments). Those who missed MGS during the PS1 era should ignore the gripes of diehards and jump in. You'll have a blast.","","true","1698783431","1698783431","true","0","3","0.502121984958648682","false"

As a huge metal gear fan, I had no choice but to ask for a refund for this master collection.  MGS1 has the left analog stick mapped to 8 directional digital input (i.e.
 the dpad) for some asanine reason where the ps1 version has true 360 degree analog support. Why? This makes the controls much more cumbersome especially as your skill level improves with the game. The 240p resolution does not upconvert cleanly (such a blurry bilinear filter) to modern displays, and has no anisotropic filtering.  Some of the achievements are also bugged and won't trigger properly.

The mgs2/3 games are a little better being the BluePoint studios HD versions from 2012, but they're still only running 720p. Also, they don't work at all on Steam Deck at the time of writing. 

That said, the bonus content is great and I can tell the devs really cared about this collection despite not having all the resources necessary to do the games justice.  Please continue to fix these games, correcting all the major grievances. Then, I'll gladly repurchase this collection, and update my review.","","true","1698778558","1698778558","false","0","4","0.518518567085266113","false"

It plays horribly in a 4:3 aspect ration in a very low resolution I believe is 480p. There's basically no settings to change for the display, only dumb things like the wallpaper that fill the empty spaces on your monitor.

Sure it's a PS1 game what do I expect? To be honest I expect better because the game doesn't have to be limited like this! Community made open source emulators do a way better job in providing you with a great experience to play this game. You can set the resolution up to 4k and beyond and even get the option to run in widescreen!

Publishers need to stop ignoring this. The community has done all the work for them already! All they have to do is give us a way to buy their roms! As an emulation enthusiast I believe in doing it the legit way. I dump my own games for emulation and I have done exactly that with MGS 2 and 3. Playing them like that is a much better experience than what the master collection has to offer. Most fans are more than willing to pay a few bucks for the game iso and get an amazing experience out of it. Sega even did it with their mega drive collection on steam!","","true","1698750909","1698750909","false","0","7","0.560270786285400391","false"

There's a lot of PS1 specific interactions and moments that aren't in the PC version, and as someone who only ever played the PC version before this I'm happy they went the emulation route. They add a lot to the game, and they even added in some options, such as the ability to add fake save data for other games that psycho mantis will read out when you get to him. The bilinear filter they put over the game does make things blurry but its far from unplayable. Seriously, play for 15 minutes and you will forget about it entirely. I was initially upset but by the time I got into the hangar I already didn't care. Yes, they should have added an option to get rid of it, but it's really not as big of a deal as I see people making it out to be. The people that are gonna emulate this already have or were never gonna buy it in the first place. I do a great deal of emulation myself, but I can recognize that not everyone can be bothered to spend an hour setting up a 20 year old game. Something I'm also guilty of is not finishing a game I started through emulation because it wasn't in my steam library and I forgot I had it. If you want a convenient way to play this game, or want to play it with achievements and cloud saves, this is the version to buy. The PC port may be lazy but I don't think the collection its self is. There's a lot of extra goodies and features (the save thing, art books, soundtracks, screenplay versions of all the games, all localisations and regional versions of the games, etc), and I'm not convinced they didn't put effort into this as a product. Realistically the only problems with 2 and 3 are resolution patches that fans have already created and will probably be released officially at some point down the line. 

They'd have to do a lot more to overwrite the joy of playing metal gear. Would recommend on sale if you've played before, and if you've never played this I recommend starting as soon as possible whether it's through this collection or not.

P.S. If you do go with this version (and want to play in english) make sure to play the North American english version since it runs at higher fps. The reviews you see complaining about input delay are using the European version that runs at lower fps.","","true","1698745230","1698745875","true","0","2","0.482213437557220459","false"

Simple;

Mgs1 salio en disco,y posteriormente a los muchos años,en formato digital,ese formato digital fue ""porteado"" para crear la hd collection en ps3 hace mas de 10 años....y esta version de pc,es un port de la hd collection de ps3.....cual incluyo mgs1 en su coleccion con otro port digital...Boom!!!!
Y lo peor de todo ,es que la version digital de ps1,y la version de mgs1 incluida en la collection de ps3,incluian mas opciones graficas.

It's been 20+ years since I played this when it came out on the PSOne and this is everything I remembered of it from back in the day. The graphics, the story, the characters. It's great. The gameplay, very surprisingly, really does hold up to this day. I was very shocked by that. First time in a long time I've been able to play an old first generation 3D game without having some complaints about the controls and feeling like I'm fighting against them. Here it genuinely doesn't feel that bad. I went in expecting the worst of it but they're very tolerable.

I'm one of the many who haven't played it since the PSOne days and don't bother messing around with ISO's or emulators. I just want something that runs out of the box and I can enjoy it. If it runs well and feels like it did back in the day without being a ""Remaster"" I'll forgive it for not being a remaster. I know exactly what I'm buying into: The modern version playable on modern hardware with some tweeks like being able to use updated controllers and a decent launcher while having easy access to the game for now and the distant future by the simple click of a ""Download"" button. The fact it comes with MGS, MGS2 and MGS3: Snake Eater and MGS2 actually looks and plays pretty damn decent, this is a damn good purchase for me considering I haven't played these games since they released originally.

MGS holds up so well in terms of it's setting, story and characters. Even some of the ""future technology"" still seems very futuristic and still plausible while remaining well grounded and not too far off what we may actually be able to achieve(If not already). Some of the conversations are a bit hammy and cheesy, unsure if this was intentional or a serious take on conversations for the period in gaming(Remember, writing in gaming took a major back seat in the 90's up until the mid to late 00's) and only now is obviously corny in parts(For one Snake and Meryl falling for each other after knowing each other less than a day and conversing maybe four or five times, heh). Still, it works. It works so damn well just as long as don't take it too seriously or take some of the writing thinking you're playing a game that was made by today Political Correctness standards.

The main issue I had was the PAL version but once I got the US version working it felt much smoother albeit I currently have to run the game in windowed mode to cap the fps at 60 without turning VSync on(Which introduces a decent amount of input lag). Not a single crash, not a single slowdown, no corrupt saves*Crosses fingers*, no headaches beyond switching to the US Version and running in windowed mode. It just works.

I'd say buy the master collection if you've not played the games since they released or you're interested in experiencing these games because you've heard so much about them and you can't be bothered with emulators. It'll be a hard pill to swallow playing these games if you weren't around for the period of their original releases because the graphics and gameplay are quite dated(Tank controls haven't seen the light of day since Resident Evil Remaster back in 2015 which was a ""remaster"" of the Gamecube 2002 remaster of the 1997 classic and used, mostly, the same controls) but once you get used to it and get drawn into the story, the origin of the recent series, you'll likely love it but that is a big hurdle initial to get over.

It's great, I'm having a blast. This one also runs well on the STEAM Deck.","","true","1698714387","1698714387","true","0","0","0","false"

Konami has addressed the issues with the input lag and the ugly filter, offering new options since a recent patch was released. You can now play this with a CRT filter and with reduced controller response time as an option in the settings. I now recommend this version.

I love the Master Books they've added, which includes the game's script, something people have wanted for a long time since Metal Gear Solid was first released. Achievements may be a big reason why you'd want to give this version a chance, too. You can freely pick the version you want to play, even foreign dubs which (as a german) I did not expect the old german dub to be included in this and I really appreciate these old dubs that were never ported before being preserved in this manner.","","true","1698710620","1716912903","true","0","0","0","false"

I played MGS1 in almost all platform, playstation 1, 2, 3, emulated, and PC ports/GOG. What annoyed me the most is that this is the worst looking MGS1 version I ever played. It's a blurry mess. I don't mind if it has low resolution but they even removed the dithering which like also part of it's art style that contributes to it's overall presentation.

Konami made something barebones that don't even look right and had the audacity to charge full price.

Those are the positives, in all other respects this is the WORST way to play this game:
Low resolution
Blurry filter (and not in an authentic CRT-like way, just a mess)
Input lag
8-way controls NOT ANALOGUE LIKE THE ORIGINAL
New bugs 

There are many other ways to play this game to get a better experience - via earlier ports, via modern emulation which looks fantastic and is easy to do, or authentically via original hardware.

This is the absolute WORST way to play this game, AVOID this port (unless significant patches arrive). Such a shame as this is one of the best games ever made and deserves better treatment than this.

[EDIT]

Since release the game has received some patches:
The filter is now optional - ""pixel perfect"" and scanline options have also been added
Controller input feels better - less laggy
ANALOGUE CONTROL HAS BEEN FIXED

A screen resolution update is all that is needed now to bring the game to a decent modern release standard fitting the price they are asking for this. This is still not the best way to play the game currently (which is what a ""Master Collection"" should be) but it is currently serviceable.","","false","1698697768","1712404864","true","0","0","0.789191842079162598","false"

It is a quarter baked, no effort cash in. They gathered the worst emulations of each game, crammed it into a single collection (which comes as five different games on steam annoyingly) and done nothing to optimize or even ENSURE THE GAME FUNCTIONS. MGS1 looks worse than it does on my PS1, blurry and plays slow. MGS2 plays at Hyperspeed without a 'beta patch' and has constant audio/video bugs, and has a bug that makes it so I can't hang from edges meaning it's soft locked and can't be beaten at all. I haven't even dared to install MGS3 yet, my favorite of the series but I've heard it's got just as many major problems and bugs so I've decided to avoid it.

also it only runs at 720P
also you can't rebind any controls other than the face buttons
also its overpriced
also KONAMI

while i am very grateful to have this available and on Steam [with achievements YAY!!!] i can not recommend this AND sleep peacefully at night, so i choose sleep

please just play it on an emulator like BIZHAWK or Retroarch

THE MASTER COLLECTION IS GREAT YOU ALL ARE JUST CHILDREN COMPLAINING FOR REDDIT KARMA.

THE GAME RUNS, IT PLAYS, AND IT HAS THE SAME FEEL AS THE GAMES OF YESTERYEAR.

I know Kojima wasn't apart of this, but are we really complaining about MINOR bugs and audio..... FROM A 35 YEAR OLD FRANCHISE??

If you think this a just that bad... then you can just emulate it all day long and have it run on 15 FPS and have it crash on you ever 8 mins.

Imagine having a game that despite being dusted and partially outdated still maintaining a level of fun and enjoyment only for that to be sucked out by clunky controls, bad resolution and an input lag that takes longer than a commercial break during Superbowl. Or a regular commercial break on Pro7 if you´re german.

Anyway, in this state i simply cannot recommend this game. MGS2 and 3 in this collection are just so much better in every way. However, for those of you who still want to give MGS1 a chance, here´s a fix:

Step 1: Refund the game
Step 2: Buy the GOG Version
Step 3: Done

Funnily enough, the GOG Version of this game suffers none of the afforementioned issues.
For once, it is based on the Integral Version, so basically the directors cut if you will.
Then, this game has full Thumbstick support, so none of that 8 direction nonsense. Also, the resolution has been upscaled and there´s no input lag to be heard of. Of course all of this might have been an issue with the original release, yes, but why not base the Master Collection version on the GOG Version and keep the shitty version for those hardcore purists? Or better yet, use Twin Snakes instead, a Remake of MGS1 with the engine of MGS2. Say what you want but this is still better than this crap.

Anyway, i´m sick of seeing a game over screen because of Snakes high ping.
Once Konami patches this, i´ll give it a thumbs up. All in all, this is still a great game at its core.

I think the game is perfectly fine. It's not a remake, it's not a remaster, it's the game exactly as it was on PS1. I think people are largely misremembering how far we've come in these sorts of games. It's been over 2 decades since this game came out. In that time there have been hundreds of games that have released, new ideas entered the mainstream, new features, new QoL essentials. Judging a past game because it doesn't have the same controls or customization options of a new release is insane. If it feels clunky, it's because it is clunky. It was clunky back then. If playing Metal Gear Solid and the game feeling like a Playstation 1 game breaks the game, then maybe just enjoy it in your memories where you can make it as sepia colored as you like. 

Game holds up, human memory apparently does not.

Este ""port"" es exactamente igual al de la PS3, en lo bueno y en lo malo, haciendo que el juego se quiera parecer lo máximo posible al original de PS1 incluyendo sus 2 versiones distintas (NTSC en NA y PAL en EU).

Los que se quejan de imput lag es porque son de Europa, incluyendo inglés de UK, y no recuerdan que el juego en Europa iba un 10% más lento de lo que debería, ya que va a 25 FPS internamente para los 50 HZ de la versión, mientras que la de Inglés en norteamérica funciona perfectamente a 30/60 FPS por ser NTSC.

El único problema real, quitando los bugs de que no se limiten los FPS correctamente o problemas con los archivos de salvado, es el audio del juego, sobretodo los efectos de sonido y del codec en concreto.


TLDR: El juego salvo unos efecto de sonido rarunos es exactamente igual al port de PS3 e intenta ser 100% fiel al juego original de la PS1.

I only played for a few minutes and the issues were immediately apparent. The filter they put on it, as of writing, has no toggle to remove it, so if you're like me and enjoy chunky PSX visuals, good luck. In fact, the only way to remove the filter is to go completely out of your way to scale down the resolution. I don't even care that they didn't try to remaster or give it HD textures or anything because there's not much you can do with a PSX title, but as a matter of taste, I never like bilinear filtering in any game.

Not to mention, as others said, there's a small, but VERY noticeable delay input with Snake taking a few moments for the signals from your controller to reach him. It's a VERY small delay but if you've recently played any other version of MGS1, it's probably immediately apparent.

It's very close to being probably the definitive way to play the game on PC, but the lack of visual options as well as the controller delay makes it a VERY mixed bag because this is, for all intents and purposes, the PSX version of the game, Psycho Mantis easter eggs, VR Missions and all, but the forced filter and controller delays aren't especially great.","","true","1698598508","1698600262","false","2","7","0.533850729465484619","false"

Die deutsche Synchro ist einfach Kult. Leider läuft diese Version aufgrund der 50Hz Thematik von früher langsamer. Daher fühlt sich die Steuerung verzögert und der Sound hört sich schräg an. Daher empfehle ich die US oder Integral Version. Diese Baustelle muss Konami nochmal anpacken.

Wer das Spiel kennt:
- Nostalgie
- Geiler Soundtrack
- Kreative Bosskämpfe

Wer das Spiel nicht kennt:
- Schlechte Grafik
- Manuelles Speichern

かなり原作に忠実な移植で、PS1特有のテクスチャのガタガタまで再現されています。
また、当時のコナミの他ゲームのセーブデータを仮想メモリーカードに保存したりなど、本作特有の多くのメタネタをサポートする機能も充実していて良いです。

ただ、原作に忠実すぎるため、グラフィック設定はなく(フルスクリーンとウィンドウモード切替ぐらいはさすがにできる)、キーコンフィグも存在しません(キーコンフィグの項目はあるが、ボタン表記を変更するだけで操作は変えられない)。
XboxのコントローラーやSteam DeckだとBボタンで決定、Aボタンでキャンセルなので注意。

あくまでPCでMGS1をプレイする環境を整えたい、または同梱されているブックを読みたいという人向けです。
グラフィックの向上などに期待している人は、いろいろ困難ですがGCのツインスネークスを買いましょう。","","true","1698548592","1698548629","true","0","7","0.545675873756408691","false"

What I don't like is how Konami doesn't attempt to have 4K support on a title released in 2023, due to my 4K panel using DSC technology, windows sometimes has a fit with fullscreen rendering in 1080P/1440P res and dumps you from fullscreen over and over. This is very frustrating when the game could simply be made to support 4K display/output. I don't care about 99% of the other complaints, this is a major letdown in terms of pliability on my system/setup for MGS1.. also the saving emulation container thing is also pretty lame, but I havn't gotten far enough to test that information for myself.

However those issues aside the game has a game breaking bug in it where I cannot even beat the game because the emulation freezes every time at the same spot after Beating Rex. When Liquid is talking the second he starts the sentence ""Thanks to Fathers DNA"" it freezes. I can still hit L1 and R1 to bring up the game menu and restart the emulation or go back to game menu. Then trying again it still freezes at the exact same spot.

But I have also noticed it in other spots as well where the Emulator will just crash and stop working and the game that runs the launcher is perfectly fine.

Hopefully modders come up with something soon because we all know Konami won't do crap to fix their broken games. just absolutely ridiculous to release a game players can't even beat because of the crappy Emulation that was used.","","false","1698528490","1698535168","false","1","23","0.630942761898040771","false"

I've been emulating games a lot in my time and to not have to worry if the game breaks 70% in, or if cut-scenes actually work and being able to have all of the games on one platform is well worth the money. 

The small things also add up: addition of achievements, plug-and-play controller support that show the buttons as PS5/XBOX which gets used in-game, wallpaper borders to fill out the 4:3 format (which add so much atmosphere if you pick the game you're currently playing), tons of art bonus material, all the VR missions, nice UI to manage it all and customizable virtual saves to be... utilized in-game...

If you are a gamer, you need to play this game as it is highly significant to the gaming art form.

My initial review was negative due to this emulated port lacking any sort of graphical enhancement features, or options. After several patches, more options were added and it is now a lot better.  Since effort was put in to give more options, my once negative review is being changed to a positive one.

See, that wasn't hard now was it?  Maybe it was, IDK... but there have been significant improvements to the presentation which I very much appreciate.","","true","1698463558","1703314062","true","0","1","0.523809552192687988","false"

It could be so, so much better, and it wasn't. I've been a fan of this saga since I was little, and they're not treating the Metal Gear saga or the players as they should. 

They promised things that they're not delivering; 

There are emulators and mods treating these games with more care. 

Until they are as they should be (and it pains me immensely to do this), my vote is negative, simply because they're not taking care of this saga.","","true","1698438462","1698438568","false","2","45","0.755640029907226563","false"

1 - esta en resolucion nativa y con un filtro bilineal que para sacar dicho efecto tenes que moddear el juego de una forma muy incomoda y se ve horrible
2 - es mucho mas comodo y vistoso de jugar en el emulador de ducksation, para nada pixelado y unos efectos mucho mas ricos en pantalla, definitivamente es un port muy mal hecho con cero ganas y una falta de respeto a la obra de hideo kojima, jueguen en emulador hasta que saque un verdadero update como se lo merece
3 - no pudieron agregar un detalle hermoso que a mi personalmente me encantaria, jugarlo con las voces en ingles y subtitulos en español
4 - tiene muy mala optimizacion de sonido e imagen y tiene crasheos el sonido y musica del juego y ni con programas de dichas guias pude solucionarlo

desgraciadamente no te recomiendo este port a menos que le metan un update de re-escalado de resolucion nativa a 1080p o 4k es incomodo de jugar, un dolor a la vista y muy mal optimizado, al momento de hacer esta review no recomiendo comprarlo

como dije una falta de respeto a la obra de hideo kojima, el sons of liberty y snake eater son mucho mas perdonables sus defectos como ports modernos de la carrera de kojima, yo compre este pack del bonus 1 por fan de la saga y este es unos de los peores ports que jugue en mi vida

This Master Collection version has a few pros, but also has all the limitations of the original game on PS1 since it’s just emulation and introduces new issues, making it an objectively worse way to experience this great game. Let Konami know that this isn’t okay: write reviews and vote with your wallet. [/h1]


Metal Gear Solid is an amazing game, and I’m glad we now have all first five games on PC in one neat package but there are more cons than pros, making this release hard to recommend. Let’s cut to the chase:

[h3]Pros:[/h3]
- Features [i]every[/i] PS1 release of MGS and its Expansion Disc, Special Missions. PAL, NTSC-U, NTSC-J and MGS Integral are all available, regardless of your region of purchase.
- Features a Screenplay Book and a Master Book, which are neat extras.
- Potential for mods. 

[h3]Cons:[/h3]
- KB/M controls are beyond awful, because PS1 emulation.
- 240p30, because PS1 emulation.
- All games will drop frames in the same exact places the PS1 did, because PS1 emulation.
- No graphics settings, because PS1 emulation – sensing a pattern yet?
- No graphics improvements unlike what emulators can offer, such as Widescreen or fixes for affine texture warping (aka ""wobbly polygons"").
- All games upscale 240p to your monitor resolution [strike]using bilinear upscale, which looks very blurry[/strike]. A toggle for bilinear filtering was added in a patch, as well as a scanline filter. 
- All games have audio issues. There are clicks and pops all over Codec calls, something known as audio dropouts. Furthermore, a lot of sound effects are not reproduced properly by the emulator.
- [strike]Aspect ratio is ever so slightly stretched, though that is hard to notice without a side-by-side comparison.[/strike] Fixed in a patch that allows for a 4:3, 16:9 (stretched) or the original, pixel perfect aspect ratio. 
- All games have noticeable input lag.
- All games have issues with controllers analog sticks handling. It emulates a D-Pad, meaning you can only ever input one of eight direction while the original release allowed for a full 360° input on the analog sticks. This makes aiming and thus the game way harder and a lot of the Special Missions disc near impossible.

I’m an MGS nerd and have been for more than 2 decades. I still have every MGS game on their original platforms. I know how this game is supposed to look, sound, feel and play like the back of my pocket. But you don't need to be a diehard fan or go on a pixel hunt to notice all of the aforementioned problems this release has.

I wasn’t expecting much from this collection but I’m still disappointed. 
Until they patch this laundry list of issues (which they probably won’t) I can’t recommend this collection and would recommend playing MGS on Duckstation or any PlayStation system instead.","","false","1698430456","1703459384","false","6","517","0.953008115291595459","false"

I beat this game before reviewing just to make sure I wasn't missing anything and... it's exactly as I remember it! I loved this game when I was younger along with the others in the collection but for MGS1 specifically, I had played it on PS1 originally and then later when it was put on PS3 through the classics on the store and this port/edition is exactly what I would have expected. I've missed the Metal Gear games a lot and this is exactly what I needed!

Si es así, te tengo una buena noticia: los tres primeros juegos de esta franquicia ya están disponibles en PC a través de Steam. Yo ya los he comprado y estoy disfrutando mucho de revivir estas aventuras de espionaje y acción. En este post te voy a contar mis impresiones sobre estos clásicos que marcaron una época.

El primero que jugué fue el Metal Gear Solid, el que salió originalmente para la PlayStation 1 en 1998. Este juego fue una revolución en su momento, con una historia apasionante, unos personajes carismáticos y unas mecánicas de infiltración muy innovadoras. Lo que más me gustó fue la forma en que el juego rompía la cuarta pared, interactuando con el jugador de formas sorprendentes. Por ejemplo, había una parte en la que había que mirar el código de barras del CD para obtener una frecuencia de radio, o una pelea contra un jefe que leía la memoria de la consola y comentaba los juegos que habías jugado.

El juego se ve muy bien en PC, tal y como lo recordaba en el juego original. No entiendo por qué hay gente que se queja de que no le hayan puesto filtros o texturas para mejorar los gráficos, si desde que se anunció se veía en el vídeo que el juego iba a ser fiel al original. A mí me parece que tiene un encanto retro que se pierde si se le cambia el aspecto. Además, el juego tiene opciones para ajustar el idioma, y los controles, así que se puede adaptar a las preferencias de cada uno.

Los otros dos juegos que vienen en el paquete fueron el Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty y el Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, que salieron para la PlayStation 2 en 2001 y 2004 respectivamente. Estos juegos son una continuación de la historia del primero, pero con unos gráficos mucho más avanzados y unas mecánicas más complejas. El MGS 2 se desarrolla en una plataforma marina llamada Big Shell, donde hay que infiltrarse para evitar un ataque terrorista. El MGS 3 se ambienta en la Guerra Fría, en plena selva soviética, donde hay que rescatar a un científico y evitar una crisis nuclear.

Estos dos juegos se ven geniales en PC, con unos gráficos muy detallados y unos efectos de luz y sombra muy realistas. Los escenarios son muy variados y tienen muchos elementos interactivos. Por ejemplo, en el MGS 3 hay que camuflarse con el entorno, cazar animales para comer y curarse las heridas. Los juegos también tienen opciones para configurar el idioma y los controles.

En definitiva, estoy muy contento con esta compra, porque son tres juegos clásicos que me encantan y que ahora puedo tener a mano en Steam. Si te gustan los juegos de espionaje, acción e historia, te recomiendo que les des una oportunidad. No te arrepentirás.","","true","1698387181","1698387181","true","0","0","0.495049476623535156","false"

No sé cuantas veces lo he terminado en hardware original, en Duckstation, en PS3 con la Legacy Collection, en la PSP...etc, lo vengo jugando desde que tenía 11 años en el 98 cuando salió. Metal Gear Solid fue el juego que hizo que me enamorara de los videojuegos, y ahora que lo acabo de terminar otra vez, me causa la misma sensación de epicidad que siempre me causó. 

-Puntos a favor: Incluye TODAS las versiones de Metal Gear Solid que se lanzaron al mercado, y además tenés el guión original del juego en la parte de extras, junto con otras cosas. Para mi, un lujo.

-Puntos en contra: No especifica qué diferencias hay entre las versiones de juegos para elegir en el menú. Es apenas un detalle, pero puede confundir si no sos un enfermo de Metal Gear Solid. Y otra cosa, si bien no me molesta para nada verlo en su estado original, como un juego de PS1, con su nuevo filtro de scanlines y todo, hubiese estado bueno agregar de forma opcional algún modo de reescalado de resolución, digo, para jugadores nuevos, y también viejos. No todo el mundo se banca una resolución tan baja en tiempos modernos, pero bueno, así es el juego que salió en 1998 y Konami dijo claramente que el juego se iba a lanzar así.

Conclusión: Es un pedazo de historia que no tiene desperdicio alguno, y tanto el desarrollo de la trama como la actuación de voces han envejecido tremendamente bien. Hacete un favor y jugalo antes de morir. Si el hecho de que se esta versión ""se ve mal"" porque está en su resolución original de PS1 te impide jugarlo, descargate el emulador Duckstation y miralo en 4k con todo reescalado y la geometría corregida. No hay excusa para no jugar esta joya, haceme caso.","","true","1698369948","1703367319","true","0","0","0","false"

I finally understand where the appreciation for the franchise stemmed from.

Going into this title my main concern was always gonna be, 'is it going to feel too old to play'? I am happy to report that this is not the case, while the game does show its age, it sports mechanics that hold up for a game released in 1998, the year I was born. Just to note a few examples; you can knock on surfaces to distract guards, you can strangle guards by sneaking up behind them, if you missed the thermal goggles, you can use your cigarette smoke to detect infrared lasers, you can get wolves to pee on your cardboard box in order to skip the hostile wolves section, and the list goes on. For a game, as experimental, in many rights as this one, it bolsters unique solutions to problems that aren't obviously stated like most modern games. Not to mention all the secret easter eggs and tidbits of dialogue you can access if you do certain actions.

Speaking of the dialogue, I want to say that this game is probably the reason we have cinematic approaches to modern games. It is true that the dialogue does the heavy lifting for the plot, which I found surprisingly compelling and not at all something I expected from a PS1 title. The emotions carried in the lines are stellar, the graphics presented on the Codec calls really bring the characters to life, and the choice of words really doesn't hold back any punches. For the careful listener, the story is full of twists that are interesting in their own rights. The style in which the game is presented also makes you feel like an 80's action hero. Whenever Snake hugs a wall for instance, the camera will position itself from several angels in a very much movie like way. Snake himself is full of bad ass one-liners, pervy comments, and compelling narrative comments on the plot that is unraveling around himself as he tries to find the answer to what his true purpose in life is.

One of the ways Snake finds his identity is through the various boss battles throughout the game. At the end of each boss battle, the enemy often reveals their true motivations behind their actions and some of the stories are genuinely sad, so much so, that it gives Snake plenty to think about throughout the course of the game. On the topic of boss battles, these were difficult! This is coming from a Souls seasoned veteran, some of these battles sat me down and humbled me. I had to change my approach and try various methods to defeat my enemy. Notable fun fights are the Cyborg Ninja, Vulcan Raven, and Metal Gear Rex. These battles really test your wits and your use of all the equipment you have gathered throughout your journey.

While I can't speak for the port itself as I never played the original Metal Gear's, I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed myself and I consider it time well spent on this title. I feel like I have finally been admitted into a secret cult with the various discussions I have had with other community members in the forums, truly a riveting experience!

Only positives I could give is that the Japanese, American and European versions, VR missions and loads of behind the scenes stuff for people interested are all here making this version sort of have some value besides its shoddy nature right now.

Could Konami have done more? Of course.
Is it a shame that the game runs at what seems to be the same internal PS1 resolution as always? Naturally. 

The game is exactly as Konami said it was, the PS1 version with some silly memory card manipulation. If you want a modern way to play MGS1 on PC, you're probably better off getting MGS1 on gog, which is an updated native PC port from years ago. That said, I knew what I was getting going into it, the game plays exactly like I remember, input lag and all.

At no point (Thankfully, after Twin Snakes) was this advertised as a Remaster, or HD Release. Could Konami have done more? ... I doubt it.  They tried once before and the result was a game that still to this day has very polarizing reviews.

The game itself is fine, for what it is.  A re-release of a game from two decades ago, a literal piece of gaming history that you cannot play anywhere else (outside of GOG i'm told.)  I played through it, and had the same fun I did then, albeit a bit quicker now because i'm older and have improved with other games.  Also there was a brief moment of shock during the [spoiler] Ocelot torture scene [/spoiler] where I went in thinking i was hot sh*t and hadn't saved in like an hour, then suddenly I was asked to go for round four when i only ever remembered doing three rounds on the PS1 version...

I'm not an audiophile, and dated graphics don't bother me as much as the average gamer, either.  But I will always enjoy being able to load up pieces of my own history and play through them in complete versions.

As for performance issues.  I did not notice any major emulation issues in the engine Konami chose, outside of the occasional audio hiccup in radio calls, the most glaring one being towards the end of the game when a particular radio call suddenly cut out audio in the left speaker of my headset.  I had thought my headset went bad at first but the sound returned immediately after the call.   Whether my luck in this was due to having a somewhat older PC or not, I can't say.

All in all, the collection so far has been fine to me for what it was released as, and maybe i'll review 2 and 3 as i complete them.","","true","1698355998","1698355998","true","2","1","0.490773886442184448","false"

They updated the game about a month ago, and I finally went back and played a bit to see what features were added. A decent amount of visual options to change the screen however you'd like (pixel perfect mode, 16:9 stretched, full screen/windowed, scan lines, NO BLUR), which was one of the main problems I felt would make this version wholly superior to other versions of MGS1. 
The language packs and different versions are easier to access and download, so you get all versions of VR missions and MGS1 (minus the twin snakes remake of course). As far as figuring out how you want to play MGS1, this port gives you all the options you could want. 
There are some issues still, like the screen and other options can only be found in the pause menu after booting the game itself, not in the options menu when initially launching the collection version. Wish I could change the settings there, but I guess that's so each version of the game saves it's own settings, if you want to play your games differently for some reason. It's just makes it more annoying to make the game look the way you want on your first time, because you have to scramble to get to the emulation pause menu before anything plays out.
Otherwise, this is a great game in a now great collection. Still not perfect, but now worthy of the ""Master Collection"" title.","","true","1698351966","1706761872","true","0","0","0","false"

I honestly out of all the games, i never finished MGS 1 as a kid on PS1 back in the day as i only played the demo disc that they did a long time ago before pc's ruled the world!

I have finished this game 2 times for fun tho, oh hell no. my power went out during my first run and i was at the final boss *keep in mind i make 5 saves per run for speed running reasons* and so i had to reboot the game, tried to load my saves for MGS1, and noticed all my saves were gone! 

I looked high and low and i confirmed that part of this game, if you save within your session, if you don't leave correctly, your saves won't save which is stupid but lucky i pushed thru and beaten the game finally after so many years, i have finished this game!

Now i did not run into any glitch's or crash's but i will say one thing. we need it to be customized for settings as there is no settings so these are ports with some lighting changes which i loved. 

I know there will be people who disagree with me and say this game and its collection is not worth it, im currently running on MGS2: sons of Liberty and im enjoying my childhood all over again. If you haven't played MGS series before, i personally say it runs what it can with its game engines and only the graphic and fps people who are needing high frames and graphics, they are just complaining and yes i know its a not the best collection but i been waiting for years for MGS to be played legally as i hate emulators and i know there are better running games on the emulators.

So what do i think of this game, i say its worth a try and i personally had a good time running it 2 times and even with its flaws, i don't call this a failure and i think having the games in some form on pc is a huge win for new and old fans. I still say if you care about top notch fps and graphics at 4k by illegal means, there are emulators  and many videos on this method and its up to you either way fun times.

If you want to get into these games but only have a PC, just emulate, but I still think it's a great game.","","true","1698333529","1698333529","true","0","1","0.476190477609634399","false"

You're better off playing an emulation or buying it from GOG.com, as they look and play WAY better than this.
Shame on you Konami for failing once again on bringing this critically acclaimed franchise series and giving us an Unity made menu running a .iso emulation port, at least the Menu looks good, but it doesn't even interconnect with every other titles...

Even if this is your only option of playing [i]Metal Gear Solid[/i], I would still highly recommend checking it out. But just be aware that it's lacking in some features you might want or expect, though on the flip side of that, it also has some really cool bonus content that you won't find in any other version of the game.

This is not a new version of the original PC release of [i]MGS1[/i] that you can find on GOG. Rather, it's the original PlayStation version running in an emulator. While this does have its benefits - better audio quality, good controller support with rumble enabled, a certain boss fight's gimmicks being fully intact, etc. - the developers unfortunately did not include any options for the quality of the emulation. There are no settings to enable or disable filters, no settings to run the game at a higher internal resolution, no options for texture perspective and geometry correction, etc. This means you're stuck with the original low 320x240 resolution of the PS1, but blown up and with a smoothing filter applied that can't be easily disabled. The game still looks okay enough, and it does feel fairly authentic to what you'd probably see on an actual PS1 for those who prefer authenticity, but the lack of settings is disappointing for a retro PC release in 2023, and it doesn't look as good as you could make it look if more settings were provided.

This version of [i]MGS1[/i] allows you to select any regional version of the PS1 game, whether it's the original Japanese version, the American version, or the European releases. The [i]VR Missions[/i] game is also included, featuring 300 missions. It even includes the previously Japan-exclusive PlayStation version of [i]Metal Gear Solid: Integral[/i], a release that included all of the changes made to the Western versions as well as new features, such as an unlockable first-person mode, a Very Easy difficulty option, balancing changes, an Altered Round mode that changes enemy placements and routes, and more, in addition to the content from [i]VR Missions[/i]. 

The bonus features and bonus content are what really make this version of the game worth checking out. The [i]Master Collection[/i] version of [i]MGS1[/i] includes two digital books:

[list]
[*]The Master Book offers a deep dive into the series' history, the game's story, its characters, and how everything ties together across the series. This book is aimed towards longtime fans, as it contains spoilers from across the entire series, even more recent entries like [i]The Phantom Pain[/i]. The presentation of this book is very impressive, and is reminiscent of the kind of hardcover coffee table book you'd find in a store for $50 USD-- the fact that it's included with this release was really appealing to me, and it doesn't disappoint.
[*]The Screenplay Book collects the scripts for every cutscene and Codec call in the game. There's not really much else to say about it, but it's another really cool addition for fans of the series, and could be a handy reference tool if you're trying to learn more about the game's story or need a refresher.
[/list]

One last important note: while the game does support keyboard controls (not with a mouse; only keyboard), they are fixed and cannot be edited. The bindings provided by Konami are the only bindings you get. If you prefer control over your keybindings, you may want to check out the GOG version of [i]Metal Gear Solid[/i] instead, which is a native Windows port of the game based on the content of [i]MGS: Integral[/i] as described above. However, if you plan to play with a controller, I would recommend this Steam release instead.

Regardless of which version you play though, I definitely recommend [i]MGS1[/i] to anyone who enjoys stealth action games. While it has aged in a few areas, namely some of the moments in the final couple of hours, it's still an overall great game, with a deep and engaging story, interesting characters, fun gameplay, an excellent soundtrack, and visuals that cram a ton of detail into a game that shipped on two small compact discs back in 1998. This specific release of it might have some rough edges, but it's still the same great game otherwise, and the new bonus content is worth checking out for any [i]Metal Gear[/i] fan.","","true","1698327703","1698328047","true","1","14","0.656657695770263672","false"

Don't get me wrong MG franchise is the only series that I enjoy the most, as kid I played so many times, from ""Metal Gear"" all the way to ""METAL GEAR SOLID 5"". They really did Kojima dirty on this one, while the game itself is good but the emulation is ""KONAMI GAME"" now, they really butchered this one.

If you've been hearing that the ""Master Collection"" was a lazy port, if you can even call it a port, you would be correct. Lack of 360 analog stick controls when the OG game actually had it is a pretty big indicator of this (but is also not the end of the world, but just goes to show the absolute lack of effort they put into it). There was an official PC port in the past for MGS1 and MGS2, but they decided to not even try to update those in any way and instead just do what seems to be an emulation. So with purchasing MGS1 Master Ver., you'd be purchasing mainly a lighter conscience, some extra stuff like a book full of cool details or secrets, and a few songs from the game's soundtrack. I believe some control differences should reflect your selected controller as well, so that makes it a little less confusing if you're solely an Xbox user or such. The game also gives virtual memory card that you can inject fake save data that allows certain easter eggs to happen that'd normally be a bit annoying to do with an emulator.

So it's not outright a .iso file plugged into an emulator, there's some degree of work gone into it and things done with it and things preset. For some, that's worth the price because they don't wanna put in the half-hour it takes to get an unlucky emulator to work. It's not a super large difference, but it's something worth mentioning at least.

This game will be different from the rest in the collection in that you use O (or B if you're Xbox) to select menu items and X (A if Xbox) to cancel. People seem to be considering this a laziness thing, but it's actually a design choice; MGS1 is kinda stuck like that in controls, so it's staying congruent with the game. Yes, they should've updated the game itself to be more ""modern-friendly"" (in reality it's moreso regional differences that MGS didn't respect until MGS4), but they should've also done a lot more as well. A little bit of options menu would've gone a long way in making people happier. Speaking of options menu, there is none for audio changes or anything, so have fun using your system default sliders when you need to alt+tab to use them, and then trying to fullscreen afterwards.

But it's not all bad. If you're a huge fan of the series, the master and screenplay books are genuinely interesting reads (major spoilers for literally the entire series in each of them though, so don't read them if you're wanting to go into the games for the story and haven't been spoiled thus far). And the game is still very playable. People might be looking back with rose-tinted glasses when they mention the PS3, but this game had extra input lag on the PS3 with an HDMI cable. Final boss was way harder than it should've been due to that. In theory, this one shouldn't have it, but I haven't rigorously tested it either. Just don't expect 60FPS upgrade, it's at 30FPS and there's definitely noticeable input lag, but it's input lag that can get used to. I haven't personally noticed the game running ""terribly"" like some might have said, but your mileage may vary. 

I'm sure there's more accurate info out there, but this is a 3AM review written by someone who has played the series on a PS2/PS3 with a scratched up disk, and later, digital downloaded version, and later, emulators, and find this experience acceptable.

I mean, hey, after all... It's MGS1 on Steam.","","true","1698302977","1698303241","true","4","122","0.848310887813568115","false"

UPDATE: They fixed this issue; right select the game in the listing in your library, properties, DLC, and check all the DLC's.
Now all they need to do is update the graphics to be on par or better with DuckStations emulation of the game

December Update: They added a lot of stuff to match the emulation of DuckStation. I'm shocked by Konami actually putting their nose to the grindstone and keep updating this. So credit where it's due, good job Konami","","true","1698294464","1703894170","true","0","0","0.523809552192687988","false"

This is a rough verdict of my favorite franchise. I remember the days of the old Metal Gear Solid on PS1, then it was neat when it came to PC the first time for Windows 98. I was hoping for nostalgia. Hear me out. . .

The old version of this for PC from 25 years ago, actually runs better on modern PC's and their Operating Systems with modern hardware than this janky, lazy port that only runs in a poorly rendered window. The old, original PC software has 3rd party patches that make this a greatly playable game for an old software title. Even without the 3rd party patches and mods, its playable enough that even back in 2014, I built the entire world while playing the Original PC version for Minecraft that was featured in IGN and Game Informer magazines and dozens of streamers at the time...

Hi! It's me. I am the disappointed Super Fan of this series.

***And that's not even to mention all of the great PS1 emulators over the years. Hell Bleem! did this tons better back on Windows XP. We already had the porting figured out! - And it's only gotten better for emulators in this modern age.

+ All of the PlayStation ported titles in this collection are of the same quality as the above mentioned game.
 
- Leave it to to Konami to release something this awful. I cannot wait for my second favorite franchise, Silent Hill, to drop the long awaited disappointment, Silent Hill 2 Remake.","","true","1698291251","1698291640","false","0","4","0.523809552192687988","false"

This is also a straight port of the HD collection fully disclosed before release. This is for the major fans that already love the series and don't mind a tiny hiccup here and there.

I recommend using a controller, the OG PC disc version of the game was quite difficult to play with just keyboard, manageable but takes some getting used to and finger bending. For me the Steam controller has been working perfectly. 

The game for the game play and story are absolutely amazing and worth it. Have some popcorn nearby for those cut scenes and Codex conversations. Those long cut scenes are worth the time.

Eveeeeet, incelemeye Konami'yi överek başlamayı çok isterdim ama yine, yine, yine ve yine şaşırtmadılar.

METAL GEAR SOLID için hayatımın oyunu diyebilirim PSX'in meşhur olduğu ve kopya CD'lerin delicesine sattığı dönemler, MGS ile tanışmıştım. Herkesin Resident Evil, Crash Bandicoot, TEKKEN oynadığı dönemler çoğu kişinin ilgisini çekmeyen, farklı bir oyundu benim için..

Oyunun hikayesi ve ilerleyişi mükemmel bir şekilde içine çekiyor ve atmosferiyle kendini tamamlıyor, kısaca Hideo Kojima'nın başyapıtı diyebilirim. Oyunu ilk oynadığım zamanlar karmaşıklığından dolayı bayağı bir zorlanmıştım, nereden gitmem gerektiğini ne yapmam gerektiğini bilemiyordum. Oynadıkça ve öğrendikçe oyun kendi dünyasına beni hapsetmeyi başarmıştı. Ninja Cyborg ile kapışmadan önceki koridor sahnesi tüylerimi diken diken etmişti, Psycho Mantis'ten bahsetmiyorum bile zamanına göre düşünülmüş aşırı derecede dahice bir özellikti. Bu oyunda ne varsa tam olarak çözemedim tuhaf bir şekilde beni içine çekiyor ve oynayınca kendimi yeniden doğmuş gibi hissediyorum, kontrolleri her ne kadar hantal olursa olsun hikayesi, Communication Tower'daki atmosfer, menü müziği, havalandırma boşluğunda sürünürken gelen o ürperti.. Bence her şeyiyle oynamaya değer harika bir oyun. Keşke kamyon çarpsa da tüm hafızamı yitirip en baştan deneyimlesem herşeyi..

Master Collection Volume 1'e gelecek olursak;

İlk fragmanı yayınlandığında adeta şok geçirdim, Konami'nin aklına ne geldi de böyle bir karar aldı diye düşünüp durdum zira Konami'den asla beklenmeyecek derecede tuhaf bir hareketti; özellikle son zamanlarda Silent Hill 2'yi de Remake yapmaları oldukça şaşırtıcı bir durumdu. Fragmanı izleyince tabii hemen bir hypelanma.. Aha dedim geliyor, oyunu en baştan oynamam için geçerli bir sebep diye sevinmiştim taa ki ilerleyen günlerde Konami oyunların çözünürlük ve fps chart'ını yayınlayana kadar.. Switch'te 720p@30fps çalışacağını görünce dedim bundan bir halt olmaz.

METAL GEAR SOLID hakkındaki izlenimlerim şu şekilde, kısaca rezil kepaze bir port olmuş. MGS normalde PC'ye çıkış yapmış bir oyun fakat ilk orijinal Windows sürümü aşırı derecede eski, yarım yamalak bir sürüm ve tuhaf bir şekilde çalışıyor, aynı şey MGS 2 için de geçerli ona daha sonra değineceğim. Oyunu alıp olduğu gibi *.bin formatlı PSX imajıyla emülatörde oynuyormuşsunuz gibi bırakmışlar. Ne çözünürlük ayarı var ne ses ne de tuş ayarları var.. Hele hele kontroller deveye cinconbalak atlatmaktan daha da zor, boss fight'larda kendi parmaklarınızı bile sinirlenip kırabilirsiniz. Tek değişen şey PS1 versiyonunun imaj dosyası üzerinde minik değişiklikler yapmışlar işte ""Memory Card"" değil de ""Storage"" falan yazıyor. Sansür falan eklemişler.. Benim en sinir olduğum noktalardan birisi de; bu soktumun oyununu PC'ye getireceksiniz ""Master Collection"" diye de başlık atmışsınız, azıcık bi uğraşın amına koyayım ya. En baştan adam akıllı native çözünürlük destekleyen, ayarları olan, grafik ve ses ayarı yapabildiğimiz bir port yapmak bu kadar mı zor amk? Bildiğin emülatörü olduğu gibi alıp koymuşlar. Konami Türkiye Twitter sayfası da 3 gün kaldı, 5 gün kaldı diyerek hype yapıyor iyice heyecanlandırıyor milleti, sonuç götüm gibi aynı.. Konami'nin de hype yaratıp milleti böyle heyecanlandırıp oyunu siktiriboktan çıkartması ayrı bir rezillik. Şimdi bazıları diyebilir oyun 30 senelik, adamlar bir de bununla mı uğraşsın? Uğraşacaklar tabii amk, adamlar hiçbir şey yapmamış zaten fanboyluk yapmayı bırakın. İsteseler otururlar baştan aşağı Unity'den sıfırdan kodlayıp köpek gibi remaster yaparlar. Heriflerin siki taşşağına denk götleri trampet çalıyor, bir de gelip burada parasını haketmeyen bir oyunu savunmayın.

İlk oyunla ilgili beğendiğim tek şey Psycho Mantis Boss Fight'da Memory Card okuma özelliğini; istediğimiz save dosyasını görsel olarak aynı PSX Bios'unda olduğu gibi editleme özelliğini getirmeleri. Konami oyunlarından istediğiniz oyunu seçip 15 blokluk Memory Card'a keyfinize göre yerleştirebiliyorsunuz. Tek beğendiğim özellik buydu, onun haricinde oyunun kendisine lafım yok ama port bildiğin hazır para kazanalım aceleye getirilmiş bir Konami yapıtı olmuş.

MGS 2&3 Hakkında:

Yazının öncesinde bahsettiğim gibi MGS 2'nin de Windows sürümü çok eskiden mevcuttu velakin çoğu cutscene'de ve oynanışta hatalar mevcuttu. V's Fix denilen bir patch ile bunlar çözülüyordu fakat oyunu native bir şekilde Windows'un son sürümünde oynamak farklı, bir de sorunlarla dolu patch ile düzeltilmeye çalışan bozuk Windows portu ile oynamak farklı. Oyunu açar açmaz sağ altta yükleme simgesi çıkınca direkt dedim aha Xbox 360'tan direkt PC'ye portlamışlar. Bu oyunlar hakkında da genel düşüncem eh işte, X360/PS3'teki HD Collection'ın PC sürümü gibi.. Kontrol ayarı yok, grafik ve ses ayarı yok, çözünürlük ayarı yok.. Yok babam yok, hiçbir bok yok ya amına koyayım niye uğraşmıyorsunuz bunlar için? Resmen düpedüz seriye hakaret bu başka bir açıklaması yok bunun.. Eğer bu seriyi Hideo Kojima çıkartsaydı böyle saçma sapan bir şekilde piyasaya sürmeye utanırdı adam, ama Konami'nin sikinde değil, oyun çıktı ya tamam amk gerisini siktir et. MGS 3'ün official Windows sürümünün çıkması da gerçekten o kadar kepazeliğin içerisinde mutluluk verici bir şey. Konami'den tek dileğim bu saçma sapan sorunları düzeltmeleri ve gerçek anlamda ""bu oyunun Windows versiyonu"" diyebileceğimiz bir güncelleme yayınlamaları..

Ayrıca şöyle komik bir şey daha var Konami Resolution Chart'ta oyunların PC'de 1920x1080@60 FPS'te çalışacağını belirtmişti, oyunlar 720p'de çalışıyor. Metal Gear Solid 2'de silah item menüsündeki item'in description ekranında da eski PS2 sürümünden leftover bırakmışlar, adamlar oradaki yazıları bile editlemeye üşenmiş. Yani diyecek bir şey bulamıyorum. Ayrıca emülatördeki blur efekti de iğrenç gözüküyor.

CREDITS'te de Hideo Kojima'nın ismine yer vermemişler, harbi yazık size..","","false","1698270029","1698270029","false","0","5","0.571816444396972656","false"

That is where my formal review of this game ends. I can say nothing about this game that hasn't already been said, but because I love this game and feel emotionally compelled to share my feelings, I will. A numbered score would not suffice to truly explain to anyone why this game is truly a masterpiece. A numbered score would not explain to anyone why this is a must play game. We should feel lucky to have lived in a time where this game could be enjoyed. We all have childhood memories of playing this game, and we could not have known that we had played a masterpiece. We have all sat through lengthy retrospective videos of the series, realizing how masterful this game was. Then we all played it again, decades latter, and realized that we experienced and loved something very special. Very few games can capture an audience, a player base, the same way. Very few games are as iconic, memorable, and have so much impact. This is a hall of fame all star, and still, the best is yet to come. 

Is this a bare bones port of Metal Gear Solid? Yes. Is it completely playable from beginning to end? Yes. Should they have spent more time optimizing for SteamDeck? Yes. Could they have done anything above the bare minimum to make this a better option to play over emulation? Yes. Is this still the masterpiece we all remember? Yes!

Metal Gear Solid is a game that was incredibly ahead of its time. This is an absolute MUST PLAY if you enjoy games at any level. The story telling and political intrigue, the music and small audio touches, the set design and atmosphere. This game revolutionized the stealth action genre and shook the gaming industry with its cinematic story telling and its stellar game play. Other studios try to emulate what this game managed to do and often fail. One thing that really set this game above all else was it's anti-war messaging. Something that was more deeply explored in future Metal Gear games. Every single boss is memorable, every environment, so many quotable lines are said in this game. 

As a fan of Metal Gear and all the work Hideo Kojima and his dev team has done, I have come to terms that Konami is not what makes Metal Gear one of the best games ever made, and I hope everyone else does too. Konami is a means to an end. They hold the rights to this amazing game, and I'm just grateful that I have a legitimate way to play on Steam. The only reason why I still have a PS3 is to play Metal Gear Solid. Konami is slowly making it so that I don't have to hold onto old hardware to enjoy old games. This is also the first time that Metal Gear Solid has official achievement support, so that's cool. I will recommend this game to anyone, without hesitation.

- The crunchy delayed audio is fixed

- There's a smoothing option now! You can switch between the pixelated look and the ugly smoothed look!

I would urge that you make a value judgement when purchasing this game: is a native PC port of Metal Gear Solid 3 worth the asking price?

Quite frankly, that's all this collection is good for. 

[list]
    [*][b]Metal Gear Solid 1[/b] appears to be an emulation of the original PS1 game and not a native port, with all of the limitations and none of the possible amelioration that an approach such as this could provide. The game has a strange bilinear filter that makes it difficult to see into distance and generally makes the game look washed out and blurry. There are no options for resolution, geometry correction,  or to restore the graphics to an authentic ""PlayStation"" like look with dithering. It should be noted that all of these options and more are present in Duckstation and, as such, [b]emulation thourgh Duckstation should be considered the definitive way to experience this game, and not the Master Collection's version.[/b]

The default English version of the Master Collection's MGS1 runs ~17% slower than intended, owing to the fact this is the PAL version of the game. This is not outlined in the launcher, and English speaking users should instead select ""English (US)"" when starting the game. The game runs at a fixed resolution of 1080p, but it honestly looks worse than that. I don't know if that's down to the bilinear filter, of it's active running at a lower internal resolution than the 1080p display resolution that's stated by Konami. There isn't even support for widescreen.



    [*][b]Metal Gear Solid 2[/b] is a straight port of the 2011 version of Substance from Bluepoint Games' ""Metal Gear Solid HD Collection"". Again, zero graphics options and the game runs at a fixed 1080p.

There is already a native PC port of Metal Gear Solid 2 with resolution options, and community fixes such as ""V's Fix"" and ""Substance of Subsistence"" implement improved controller configuration support and alternative 3rd person shooter style camera reminiscent of the later MGS games after Subsistence. These features are absent in the Master Collection version, however you do get the improved textures that were included in the HD Collection versions of the game. Essentially, you need to decide for yourself which is more important to you.

For a more complete comparison of the best ways to play MGS2 on PC, [url=https://youtu.be/fLrcDoJt9_E?si=q0-TBFluzvqZgAkd]this guide[/url] is your best bet.



    [*][b]Metal Gear Solid 3[/b] is, again, a straight port of Bluepoint's HD Collection version and amusingly it still has a copyright dated to 2011 on the main menu as of the posting of this review. MGS3 has previously been neglected on the PC, so there's nothing else to compare the Master Collection version to, but the still complaints and limitations still remain. You have a fixed
[/list]

Anecdotally, loading times have been terrible for me on MGS2 and 3. There's a huge delay moving between rooms, about 30 seconds, and it really grinds gameplay to a halt. I don't know if this is down to running this game from a Hard Disk Drive, but I have a high spec CPU and an NVIDIA 3080 so I really don't have the energy to diagnose problems like that at this point. I think it's reasonable enough to assume these games should work fine out of the box considering they would be running from the 360's DVD drive back in 2011.

For that reason, and the sheer lack of graphics options for each game listed above, I will be pursuing a refund for this product. There are better ways to play the first two games on PC, and Metal Gear Solid 3 on its own just isn't enough of a value add for me.","","true","1698258332","1698259179","false","1","7","0.551020383834838867","false"

Não vale o preço cheio, todavia pelo pacote de jogos inclusos (os do MSX e o Sons of Liberty, ambos também disponíveis anteriormente no GOG) e agora incluindo o Snake Eater (sem ser o remaster que será lançado em breve), faz valer a pena pela história.

Zerei MGS1 no Duckstation pela primeira vez e qnd vi q ele iria voltar porém de forma oficial nos consoles e principalmente na Steam (sem ter q depender daquela bosta de versão da GOG) fiquei muito feliz, porém quando vi as primeiras imagens, comecei a achar o jogo feio, sim eu sei q o jogo é de 98 e foi lançado para o PS1, mas poxa, o Duckstation sem nenhuma config parecia ter deixado o jogo mais bonito doq as screenshots oficiais.
Chegamos agora que o jogo lançou, e é aquilo q eu tava prevendo, um port CRU e PREGUIÇOSO da versão de PS1, aqui vai as características:
-O jogo roda nativamente a 240p (vc não ta lendo errado) com UPSCALING pra 1080p, deixando o jogo MUITO borrado.
-Travado a 30 fps, no Duckstation é possível emular o MGS1 a 60 fps, porém a versão oficial da Konami não, qualé, é um jogo de 98, daria pra dar um fps boost.
-Padrão de controle desatualizado, isso vc até pode se acostumar, mas sério, Confirmar com o B (Bola) e Voltar no A (X)?
-Falta de opçoes de filtragem de textura, efeitos e sombra.
-Delay nas cutscenes, qnd eu joguei no Duckstation não existia esse delay nas cutscenes, agr a versão oficial adicionou esse bug. =V
-Obrigatoriedade de jogar com controle, pra quem não tem grana pra comprar um controle vai acabar se ferrando bastante.
-E o mais importante, O PREÇO, sério Konami? 100 reais em um jogo de 98? Isso pq to falando dop jogo separado, pq se pegar tds, da 300 reais.

Conclusão: Se a Konami com esse remaster achou q iria conseguir enganar os fãs e voltar a ter a sua reputação de volta, parabéns, falhou miseravelmente, sério q a empresa que tem pachinko até no cu ""não tem dinheiro"" pra fazer um remaster decente de um jogo de PS1? Agr é só a gente torcer para q o remake de MGS3 e de Silent Hill 2 por algum milagre saem bons.

Dica: Se vc quiser experimentar MGS pela primeira vez, sugiro vc emular o MGS3 em um emulador de PS2 ou emular a HD Collection (2011) em um emulador de PS3 ou emular o próprio MGS1 pelo Duckstation.","","true","1698242966","1698242966","false","1","21","0.735658347606658936","false"

Da brauche ich glaube nichts besonderes zu schreiben. Fast jeder wird es kennen und sogar gespielt haben. Bei mir ist es Tatsächlich über 20 Jahre her, seitdem ich dies zuletzt mit Freunden im Jugendclub auf Playstation 1 gespielt habe. Ich bin echt froh, dass es endlich für PC gibt bzw. Steam. Es gab ja schon glaube generell eine PC Version. Und es gibt Steam Errungenschaften.

Leider ist die Steuerung irgendwie mir noch total Fremd. Mit dem Stick läuft es sich zwar gut, aber als ich in Deckung war, rutsche ich manchmal raus, weil der Stick 2mm nach Rechts/Links rutschte :D

Auf der Steam Seite steht es nicht, aber es sind die deutschen Original Synchronstimmen dabei. Das ist sowas von geil, da wieder drin zu sein. Snake, Colonel, Maryl, Master, Ocelot etc. ---Edit, damit es nicht zu falschen Aussagen kommt. Ich rede hier NUR von Metal Gear Solid 1... die anderen waren glaube nie deutsch Synchronisiert. Daher wird der Haken bei Deutsch nicht angegeben.---

Die Geschichte, das Gameplay und die Sounds sind einfach Legendär.

Kauft es, spielt es, liebt es :D
Für 60€ bekommt man zudem Metal Gear 1/2 von glaube NES, halt dieses hier Metal Gear Solid, und auch Metal Gear Solid 2 und 3. Oder holt euch ein Key für 40-45€.

Einzige zwei kleine Kritikpunkte sind:
1. Keine wirkliche 16:9 Auflösung, ich hab hier Links/Rechts was frei
2. Sehr pixelige Grafik - ja, genau so ist/war die PS1 Version. Aber hätte man die Grafik nicht ""glatter"" und etwas Hochauflösender machen können? Oder kann man da was Einstellen?","","false","1698241522","1698241756","true","1","22","0.709545373916625977","false"

I have shat out numerous turds far superiour than what Konami has given us. This is an absolute disgrace to the legacy of one of the most beloved IP's and such a massive disrespect to the fans. Go fuck yourself

You would think that they would have put in a little bit of love? Maybe a little touch on the graphics, fix the warpy textures, add in some widescreen, just anything that shows that they fucking cared. Something more than just a fucking screenplay... But no, they just wanted a quick cashgrab. 
I've had more frames going through my dad's old slideshowpictures than you have in your fucking game... It runs worse than on my playstation one, that was beaten to shit. It's like a virus infested computer trying it's absolute best to run something but in the end you just want to pummel that sucker with a baseball bat and down a bottle of vodka.
You are paying 60 euro for emulators and roms, which run like absolute ass, with achievements though. Thank you so much Senpai Konami, for atleast giving us fucking achievements. Thank you, we are not worthy to receive your blessing. Uwu 

Just play the old versions. Konami isn't a joke anymore at this point, it's like a sad depressed old man that has pleasure in kicking kids of bikes and smoking cigarettes while laughing with his rotten teeth and belly hanging under his piss stained wifebeater shirt. I hope Johnny Somali takes a big shit in your building and rubs it all over the walls Konami, and that whatever knobhead gave this garbage the green light, gets dropkicked down the stairs by an obese woman in spandex with a high pitched scream.

Nowe badania pojawiły się na Gamesensor, gdzie badacze zajęli się sprawdzeniem, ile tytułów dostępnych na Steam oferuje polską wersję językową. Polscy odbiorcy są wyraźną, ale dość małą częścią społeczności platformy Valve – stanowią grupę około 1,35% (chodzi o osoby grające, komentujące i komunikujące się w języku polskim). Co ciekawe, to wyraźny spadek o 0,58% w stosunku do poprzedniego miesiąca (dane Valve). Mimo wszystko gier w naszym języku, jeżeli chodzi o całkowity katalog tytułów dostępnych na Steam, nie ma wcale wiele Powyższy wykres jednoznacznie pokazuje, że na ponad 14 tys. dostępnych na Steam płatnych gier, zaledwie 6-7% oferuje polską lokalizację. Ciężko się jednak temu dziwić. Największą część katalogu platformy stanowią gry niezależne, niskobudżetowe. Nic dziwnego że studia nie stać na lokalizację na inne języki niż angielski (albo nawet rodzimy język samego studia). Dlatego ciekawiej jest zapoznać się z wykresem przedstawiającym podobne statystyki, ale pod kątem wyłącznie gier sprzedanych w co najmniej 10 tys. egzemplarzy Tu jest już znacznie lepiej, choć nieco „wyboiście”. W ciągu lat liczba gier z polską lokalizacją wzrastała, ale „załamanie” nastąpiło Na szczęście sytuacja się poprawiła, aż do historycznie rekordowych 26.65%. Tendencja jest wzrostowa i bardzo to cieszy. Co ciekawe, obecnie na Steam jest około 951 gier po polsku. Pozostaje pytanie – to dużo czy raczej mało? nie będę kupował brak polskiego angielskie gier nie chcę wielka szkoda że brak polskiego firmy gier robiący wspaniałe kotlety olewa Polaków a ci i tak ich uwielbiają  ta gra jest porażka  szkoda że nie ma polskiego żałuję że kupiłem tą grę zwrotu nie mogę już kupiłem za wcześnie przed premierą","","true","1698231914","1698860644","false","2","10","0.556972622871398926","false"

Why this was censored it out of my knowledge, because the original PS1 release in germany was uncut.

[h2]""Thank you, snake.""[/h2]

At the end of the day, this is Kojima's masterpiece from the late 90s that launched the metal gear franchise into what it is today. This game is, at it's core, a masterpiece of it's time. Considering it launched for the playstation 1, the sheer visual design is phenomenal, not to mention the gameplay intertwined with the plot, dialogue and quality of the cutscenes. And that remains Kojima's legacy. To the point that he still shows up in the credits, which were thankfully left untouched. The entire game is literally untouched besides button formatting for whichever controller you want to use.

It's obvious that this is just shoddy emulation running, and a lot of the games pains are apparrent in that. There's not much in the way of settings available, and there are blatant issues that Konami seem to be aware of, and I sincerely hope they iron them out. They've lost goodwill all around deservedly, and they won't earn it back with shoddy release issues like the master collection had. 

Performance woes are still apparrent at the time of writing, I had to play the entire game in windowed mode, hopped early on from english UK to english US and then back again due to the severe audio crackling, my playthrough still suffered major stuttering issues (despite said Vsync fix) and input delay showed up in certain segments of the game. 
But all in all, for what you get, the collection does the game justice, especially after the horrible launch issues of not giving people access to most of the game have been fixed.

You have access to both the base MGS game, as well as special/vr missions and Metal Gear Solid Integral, each in a multitude of different languages. The included Master and Screenplay Book are wonderful to have, and grant more insight into the game itself, as well as show off the phenomenal artworks of Yoji Shinkawa. 

If you want to legally play Metal Gear Solid again, this is certainly one of the ways. Granted, the GoG version is technically a far better version as it is an actual PC Port for MGS with much better stability, playability and configurations. I'm uncertain if it comes with all the extras, but at that point, you just need to ask yourself if you want it on steam or not. 

Konami doesn't deserve praise for this. But hell, it's about time it hit steam. The launch state was abysmal, but things should only improve going forward. Get it cheap if you can, don't give them more money than they deserve. I got the whole package for less than 40€, if you can get a similar deal, you'll be getting MG1-3 with a bunch of extras, and if you're a metal gear fan and want to relive the games, that's an alright package. 

If they iron out all the kinks, I'll change this to a positive recommendation. The game is 10/10, the emulation not so much.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Original review on 25/10/23 - playtime ca. 30 minutes (impossible due to launch issues)
[h2]My disappointment is immeasureable and my day is ruined. [/h2]

I've wanted to play this game again for years. And they've played us like goddamn fiddles. They know the fanbase is massive, which is why they dropped this. The state in which they dropped this however, is just atrocious. I just wanted to play MGS and I can't even enjoy it. The issues are too many, the audio crackles to the point that it's stabbing my ears, the input delay is tolerable but still a glaring problem and how on earth the game has inconsistent FPS reports popping up is utterly beyond me.

Metal gear is a cash cow for konami. But they keep it in a cage with rusty, jagged spears stabbed into it's flesh whilst they squeeze it for all it has left to give.

(Update 1.)
Audio Crackling issue as well as bad FPS in cutscenes can be resolved by downloading the American version of the game (English US). Now that that's fixed, I'll be able to go through the game without my ears getting stabbed and update the review accordingly if anything else improves.","","false","1698227990","1698502895","false","0","17","0.618167400360107422","false"

""THINK AGAIN."" - No, but serious.  Consider this before buying.

I've played Metal Gear since the 90's. I know what I'm talking about. Passion. Soul. The main reasons I fell in love with this series and the story.

I pre-ordered this game and it is a DISASTER and INCOMPLETE. The content is not even available to download in the Bonus Content. MG1 and 2 were LATE being available to download compared to the other games. There's visual and performance issues throughout the collection.

But my biggest issue is the EFFORT by Konami. It's just a mess and I am not happy waiting for them to patch a £49.99 game that consists of OLD GAMES with unavailable content that could easily be found for free. I paid money for this collection because I'm a loyal MG Fan. Give and take. For the connection over the years. But this? This should have been a straight forward collection.

KONAMI ARE SO UNPROFESSIONAL AND GREEDY with this incomplete catastrophe and are using Metal Gear to cashgrab your hearts. 

If you love this collection and it works for you.  That's great and I wish that was me. But, I'm getting a refund immediately. Maybe I'll get it when it's appropriately ready and like, £20 maximum.

After all these years, this is now about principle. FKonami.","","true","1698225887","1698227307","false","0","10","0.582013964653015137","false"

You DO NOT have these issues with this game playing on it's original hardware. Why it winds up looking worse on PC is beyond me.

MGS has momentary hiccups as well as loading times???? I'm not sure why the game hangs during loading features and the transition from Disc 1 to Disc 2 has this cutscene where the discs are being swapped. I'm not sure if it's Konami trying to be cute, but it's not necessary, it breaks the immersion and will more than likely cause the game to be useless for speedruns.

Thankfully this game is not fully censored, even though the Johnny scene has underwear, anything else that the game originally had as well as all the original lines are intact. The game doesn't break due to prolonged game time but saving is broken, or saving is something that wasn't explicitly explained prior to starting the game. There are people that are losing their save files because of missed steps or because the game implemented saving poorly.

This is an old game, Konami. You need to either bring instructions or leave manual saving in the cutting room floor because this is something that did not need to translate over to modern day gaming.

I can't really defend this, and a modded version of the GOG version for this not only runs better but looks better, as well as it takes full advantage of every corner of your screen. I can't recommend this in the state it is in, and I'm actually quite upset I even bothered with Konami... again.

This is obviously an essentially untouched copy of the PS1 game bundled with its own terrible emulator. They put the bare minimum effort into this release. If the experience improves over time, I may revisit this review, but here's my notes on my release day experience.

- Whatever emulator they're using is applying absolutely no filters or enhancements. There's no internal resolution upscaling, no correction for PS1 texture warping, nothing. In fact, the image actually looks a little soft.
- It appears to be locked to some kind of integer scaling because it doesn't quite fill the screen vertically.
- If you use the Steam menu to exit instead of using the game's built in menu, there's a chance it will delete your save data. This has happened to me once so far. Luckily I was only an hour or two in.
- Some sound effects aren't quite right, they're overdriven or have been compressed or something. One in particular that comes to mind is the beep effect when you're selecting a saved frequency in the codec. It sounds rather scratchy compared to when I've played this game on other platforms. I blame this on poor emulation.
+ There is an in game menu you can bring up with LB+RB to do things like reset the game or swap controller ports for a particular boss fight.

This release was very obviously a quick cash grab. I hate to sound like an armchair general, but I could have done better myself, and I know so because I've done it. There are much better ways to play the PS1 version of this game on PC. In my opinion there are only two reasons to play this version of the original Metal Gear Solid.
- Steam achievements
- Ease of install. You don't have to worry about manually setting up your emulator to play it, just install it from steam and hit play.","","true","1698211386","1698211386","false","0","8","0.582197427749633789","false"
